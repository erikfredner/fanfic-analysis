And speaking of reviews, please give me some. I love reviews. They\\'re like soul food. Recipe: One review, one Internet connection, one reader, one very happy author...FONT FACE=\"GARAMOND\"centerChapter One/centercenterPotters\\' Day/centerEverything was quiet on Privet Drive, and Dudley was quite glad for it. It had been years since he had seen his cousin, Harry, and Dudley was quite glad for that, too. Of course, he\\'d heard things about him. He always heard people whispering on the corner. Dudley made sure to stay away from those people. Abnormal. Harry, judging from what the people on the streets had been saying, had twins- a boy and a girl- the same day Dudley had his own two beautiful twins- also a boy and a girl. And yes, Dudley was quite glad he hadn\\'t heard from any of them.As a matter of fact, it had been years since the \"M\" word had ever reached Dudley\\'s ears. As far as Dudley was concerned, that was a good thing.However, he had noticed odd, bad things. Especially that one morning.Dudley had first realized that those insane, abnormal people were at work while he\\'d been walking down the stairs in his pajamas with his hair not even brushed. He jumped as an owl flew past the window in the front of the house. He kept watching. Yes, there was another. And another. They were watching the house! Spying on himself and his family. His cousin must have done this!Owls flying around during the day in swarms. Spiders crawling all over the place, just as they had when his son and daughter were born. Not only owls and spiders, but snakes- tons of snakes. All of them were moving around wildly.His father had told him about owls. He\\'d never mentioned spiders and snakes, though.They were all watching them! His cousin was right then planning the perfect time to jump out and get revenge of some sort.Dudley recognized the signs immediately. The \"M\" word\\'s work, obviously. As soon as he got home from work, he\\'d nail everything shut. No taking chances with those people. Why, his cousin had nearly set the backyard on fire once, but Dudley had immediately seen that evil spark in his eyes and had gone to get help, and in doing so had saved the day. No, no taking chances with these people. They were dangerous. Yes, sane, ordinary people like him were all in danger. As a matter of fact, he couldn\\'t wait until he got home from work. Dudley would have to protect his family and his home immediately. This matter had to be dealt with right away. Dudley quickly worked up a story and made his voice shaky and muffled, as if he had a cold. He hadn\\'t done this since he was a child, but desparate times called for desparate measures.Dudley called his office and said that he was severely ill- they shouldn\\'t expect him at the office today.As he was saying his good-byes and listening to the get-wells from his coworkers who were already there, his wife Evian came into the room and looked at him suspiciously.Dudley put his fingers to his lips and tiptoed to the window, wishing that the floor wouldn\\'t creak everywhere he stepped. It hadn\\'t done that with his cousin- his cousin had probably cursed it somehow. He mustn\\'t be seen or heard. Their spies were everywhere, probably waiting to destroy the normal people who weren\\'t like them. Yes, that was it. He could easily see his cousin waiting crouched in the bushes, holding that awful wand, holding it ready to blow him and his family to smithereens. He brushed aside the curtains, dodging the sunlight like an overgrown beached whale would dodge the ocean. He stood against the wall, trying to suck in his large frame to no avail.His wife, Evian, gasped, seeing an owl fly by and then another.Dudley let the curtains fall.\"What should we do?\" Evian whispered, frantic.\"We must stay calm,\" Dudley said as if he were very important and stretching himself as tall as he could go. He tried to suck in his stomach, but gave up when he realized the only change was that he was red in the face. \"I shall go out into that world and get supplies to protect ourselves. But, Evian, my dearest, have the children ready. We may need to leave in a hurry. We must keep them safe.\"Evian pinched his cheeks, making them red and leaving two white finger marks on each cheek. \"You\\'re so brave,\" she said fondly.\"Yes,\" Dudley agreed, putting on his modest expression. \"I must go now. Be brave, Dearest. Be brave.\"Dudley dashed out of the kitchen as quickly as he could, which wasn\\'t all that fast if one actually thought about it. He heard Evian\\'s sigh from the kitchen and reminded himself that he was on a mission. He must protect his family at all costs. He backed slowly out of the house, carefully trying not to trip over anything. He locked the door behind him, and, certain that the lock worked, turned and left. He would simply have to hope that nothing would happen to his family while he was gone.He drove to the hardware store on the corner. Oh, no. They were already standing there, conspiring among themselves, two of them wearing robes and every one of them oblivious to everything around them- at least, that\\'s what they wanted him to think. But Dudley Dursley wasn\\'t dumb enough to fall for that. Whistling innocently, Dudley drove past and parked a block away. His family was more important than his fear. He had to protect them.Slowly, trying to act casual (and failing), he ambled to the hardware store, still whistling a tuneless tune.As he walked by the people on the corner, carefully averting his eyes from theirs, he caught snippets of the conversation.\"-Yes, Harry Potter. Escaped again-\"\"-He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\"\"-Gone. Can\\'t find him!\"\"-children?\"Ah, yes. Harry did have two children. He\\'d probably tried to kill them himself. Dudley had heard of someone called He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. He wasn\\'t sure from where, though. Harry must have turned so evil and backwards that even his fellow institution friends couldn\\'t stand to say his name unless he or she was incredibly brave.Dudley, careful not to make eye contact, bought a hammer, plenty of wood and nails, and walked out of the shop. He went home and nailed up every entrance he could think of. He stuck cotton in all of the drains because he knew that abnormal people like Harry had funny ways of doing ways of doing things. Last but not least, although it was in the middle of summer, he set up a fire in the fireplace. That way, if Harry\\'s kind took after old St. Nick, they\\'d be discouraged and wouldn\\'t be able to sit down for weeks.With the house sealed up, Dudley went upstairs. Evian had moved Shelton and Pernella\\'s cradles into their bedroom so they could watch them through the night.Although everyone in the house was sweating, they eventually fell into a restless, but snore-filled sleep.center* * */centerIn the middle of Privet Drive, the lights suddenly went out. They didn\\'t go out one at a time as they had so many years before, but the pale white lights from the street lamps went out all at once. It was late, and there weren\\'t many lights on in the houses. People, if they had noticed it, probably would have blamed a power outage.Two figures seemed to appear out of thin air. One was a woman with a large amount of bushy brown hair which she had tied back into a bun although a few strands escaped the bun\\'s tight hold. It could be seen that her teeth, when she smiled, were a bit large, but she wasn\\'t smiling now. The other figure was a tall man with fiery red hair and a heavy sprinkle of freckles all over his face. The two stood before 4 Privet Drive. Once they saw each other, the woman, Hermione Granger, said, \"Well, this is the muggle world.\"Ronald Weasley glared at her. \"I know that. I\\'ve been here before. I just didn\\'t think it would be for this.\"\"I can\\'t believe it happened, though,\" Hermione said, as if hoping he would tell her nothing bad had happened at all as she cradled one of the babies in the crook of one arm, her wand in the other.\"So? Voldemort\\'s coming back to power. We all saw it coming.\" Ron\\'s voice was harsh, \"I\\'m just glad Harry didn\\'t get himself killed.\"Hermione glared at him. \"Do you know how close he was?\" she whispered hoarsely. \"He was trying to do the same thing his mom did, except with two.\" She indicated the sleeping babies in her arm and in Ron\\'s arms. \"If we hadn\\'t come along...\" She let the sentence end there, not wanting to finish it for the fear that it had truly almost happened. She swallowed as Ron looked away.Ron was silent for a few moments. \"But why do we have to leave these two with them? You saw what they did to Harry. Plus, they\\'re muggles. The worst ones, too.\"\"As far as this law is concerned, Harry is dead. He hasn\\'t been here in years. By law, the children go to the closest relatives in the family.\"\"Stop making stuff up, Hermione. Harry\\'s just trying to keep Voldemort away from them.\" He pointed to the scars on both of their foreheads with his wand. \"If he can get Voldemort to believe they\\'re dead, maybe he won\\'t come after them.\" Through the years, Ron had learned to say Voldemort\\'s name without flinching. Hermione had learned also.\"I don\\'t see why they couldn\\'t have stayed at Hogwarts,\" Hermione said stubbornly. \"We would have taken care of them.\"\"And what would happen the second they step off the grounds or out of our sight?\" Ron snapped back. \"Face it, this is the right thing to do. I hate to do it, sure, but we couldn\\'t think of anything else. This will keep them safe for a while.\"\"Do you have the note?\"Ron held up his hand, letting a piece of paper fly loose in the breeze while holding on to one end of it. \"I put some threats in this too. If dear Dudley doesn\\'t show this to them when they\\'re old enough, or when they ask about their family, I said bad things would happen. Really bad things.\"\"Ron!\" Hermione scolded. She and Ron both knew she wasn\\'t serious, though. Without telling Ron, Hermione had added a few surprises herself.\"Come on. Harry wouldn\\'t want us to hold it off. We have to get back to Hogwarts and figure out how to deal with Voldemort again. And visit Harry in the infirmary. He\\'s been sapped of all his energy. Madam Pomfrey won\\'t even let him talk. It\\'ll take him weeks to sleep off this one.\" He tried to grin, but failed miserably. They stood in silence for a while, looking from the babies in their arms to the front step of the Dursleys\\' front step. Sometimes they\\'d look down the street, but not once did they look into the other\\'s eyes.\"I can\\'t believe it. All those years, and then he comes back with full power,\" Hermione finally said.\"And of course he picked up where he left off,\" Ron said dryly. \"Trying to kill Harry. And these two.\" He indicated the two sleeping one-year-olds with his wand again.\"Doesn\\'t it strike you odd that the same thing happened? Harry, when he was one. Parents died. He got that scar. Had to live with muggles. And then these two. He would have died for them if we hadn\\'t come when we did. They got scars, too. And now, they have to live with muggles.\" Hermione had gotten used to calling them muggles a long time ago. Ron knew that, although she wouldn\\'t admit it if asked, Hermione called her own parents muggles.\"Of course I think it\\'s weird. But there are two of them. And Harry turned out okay. Even my mom noticed,\" he joked, not mentioning that compared to Fred and George, all boys were good.She shook her head, refusing to believe him. \"I hope they\\'re okay.\"\"Me too. Well, I guess we\\'ve put it off long enough.\"Hermione adjusted the blanket around the baby girl in her arms so Ron couldn\\'t see a tear slide down her cheek. \"Yeah.\"Ron quietly took the girl from her and carried both the boy and girl to the front step. Hermione followed slowly. As he set them down, he said, \"Never forget us. Your dad, Uncle Ron, Aunt Hermione. Deal?\" One of the babies yawned and turned over. Ron sighed and placed the paper on the boy\\'s blanket and pinned the blanket and the note together.Behind them, Hermione said good-bye also, and then Ron walked with her back to the sidewalk.\"You know, if this keeps up, instead of Harry Potter Day, I think they should just call it Potters\\' Day,\" Ron commented.\"Let\\'s hope it doesn\\'t,\" Hermione said sharply.They looked around them, and, seeing no one watching, seemed to disappear in the middle of the sidewalk. As soon as they did so, all the lights blinked back on.centerChapter Two/centercenterLetter on the Doorstep/center\"Don\\'t you dare!\" a voice yelled hoarsely. \"If you even so much as-\" the voice was familiar, yet far away, and he couldn\\'t quite place it. Although it was slightly hoarse, it still sounded nice, as if just the sound of it meant safety. The voice\\'s owner started to mutter to himself. Or maybe it was to him. It was suddenly cut off by a different voice- one that was the complete opposite. One syllable of it was nearly sickening, revolting, disgusting. It made him shudder just to think about that voice.\"Oh, come now. You don\\'t think that I\\'d let them live, do you? I won\\'t even be able to take care of those two until I kill you. It\\'s a part of history.\"The words were louder now, but soft and slightly murmured, like the person was speaking through something. He couldn\\'t understand most of the words, but he once again knew that the owner of the voice was crying.\"Oh, how touching. But come, it\\'s time to get back to business. Now, where were we before we were interrupted last time? Oh, yes. Enjoy watching your children die, Harry-\"He saw a blinding flash of light. The voice became strained, but it kept on. By now, he couldn\\'t understand any of the words through the sobbing and the person in the background, threatening. He saw more bright flickers of bright light. The voice sounded more strained and tired, as if the person was giving everything he had into the words.\"Harry! What are you-\"James sat straight up in bed. He looked around and pulled a string. A bare light bulb, a thirty watt, attached to the ceiling, blinked on. He reached for his glasses as he realized that he was covered in sweat. He looked in the direction of the other small bunk, where his sister, Lily, was also sitting straight up.\"You too?\" he asked.She nodded silently and the leaned over and stuck her hand under the bed after wiping sweat off of her forehead. First, she fetched a pair of glasses identical to his, slipped them on her small, skinny nose. She stuck her hand under the cot again. A few seconds later, she raised her hand once more. On it, James saw just what he had expected. A brown spider. A brown RECLUSE spider, Lily was always saying with pride. James himself went to his cot and felt behind it before he lifted a large garter snake. They\\'d found the two animals a year or two ago. Apparently, they had escaped the cold of winter by hiding in their stockings at Christmas. Every once in a while, the children wondered how that could have happened. They hadn\\'t found any answers, though, and the spider, named Brownie, and snake, named Poison, had remained good and loyal pets.\"Think it\\'s time for breakfast?\" Lily asked. She started brushing her fingers through her hair, knowing what the answer would be.\"Isn\\'t it always time for food here?\"Lily felt under her cot again and this time came up with a brush. She tried to pull it through her black mass of curls, but after about five strokes gave up and gave the brush to James, slipping Brownie under her hair at the back of her neck. James had better luck with his hair, but it still took him a few minutes to get all the knots out. He himself stuck Poison in his shirt, which used to belong to his cousin and was so big that the lump around his waist wouldn\\'t attract that much attention. After that, the two pulled their bangs down to completely cover the scars on their foreheads. When they were younger, they had asked Uncle Dudley about them, but he had simply muttered something about a plane crash and then yelled at them for asking.Finally, they went out into the hall as quietly as they could. Aunt Evian and Uncle Dudley, along with their cousins, Shelton and Pernella, were upstairs, asleep.They had several chores to do in the Dursley home. Every day, they cleaned the entire house and did all the lawn work, whether it was a school day or not. Those, plus the extra chores, or favors, as the Dursleys called them, took up their time entirely.Together they walked into the kitchen. They gasped when they saw that Aunt Evian was at the table, reading the paper and eating toast. James felt Poison tighten around his waist, nearly suffocating him. Lily felt Brownie rub her fangs together. Both animals wanted to get the Dursley family to punish them for what they did to James and Lily, but the children never let them for fear the Dursleys might take their pets away or, worse, kill them.\"Oh, so you two finally get up and out. I want you two to know that I had to get up and make breakfast myself. It\\'s very good, too, if I do say so myself. Not that you two will be having any of it. You\\'ll have extra chores for your tardiness and laziness. Now get the mail.\"Lily squeezed James\\'s hand. He nodded slightly. She immediately darted out of the kitchen to go get the mail while he started making the two\\'s breakfast.Lily went out onto the doorstep. She knew the mail wouldn\\'t be there, but it was nice and warm compared to the Dursleys\\' home. And the sun never failed to cheer her up. Although she would never tell James, she often got sick of it- life with the Dursleys and everything about it. She hated the school they went to, where Pernella\\'s group of friends simply loved to pick on her, and where James was her only friend. Everyone else was afraid to be friends with either of them because everyone feared the wrath of Pernella\\'s group and Shelton\\'s group, who loved to pick on James. After breathing in the fresh air for a few moments, she walked back inside and closed the door silently. She picked up the mail scattered on the floor. Three were bills; two were letters to the Dursleys, but it was the last one that attracted her attention the most. The address read:FONT FACE=\"SIGNATURE\"centerJames and Lily Potter/centercenter4 Privet Drive/centercenterThe Cupboard Under the Stairs/centerFONT FACE=\"GARAMOND\"Holding the envelope delicately in one hand, she walked slowly into the kitchen, as if the slightest breeze might crinkle the paper. This was their first piece of mail. Ever. Who could possibly write to them? Why? She put the mail on the table silently. Then she cleared her throat and said to James, \"We got a letter.\"James\\'s eyes nearly popped out of his head. \"What!? We got a letter? From who? Why? What?\" James started spilling out questions.Aunt Evian nearly choked on her slightly burnt toast. Her brow wrinkled. \"Who did you say it was for? Who is it from?\"\"I don\\'t know who it\\'s from, but it\\'s addressed to James and me.\"Suddenly, Aunt Evian was on her feet, diving for the letter, snatching it out of Lily\\'s hand, and bellowing, \"DUDLEY!\"The younger two humans (not to mention their pets) in the kitchen heard a pounding on the floor above them and looked at each other, confused. After a few hurried shouts of \"What is it?\" and \"I\\'m coming. Don\\'t worry,\" and \"I\\'ll be right there,\" the children saw their Uncle Dudley pant into the kitchen, along with Shelton and Pernella.The run down the hall and tumble down the stairs had not helped his looks. He was red in the face, and his cheeks were huffing and puffing in and out as if they were red hot air balloons that had a hole in them and were repeatedly blown up all the same. His blond, greasy-looking hair now looked orange against his red scalp. His numerous chins quivered as he bent over and laid his beefy arms on his thick legs. \"Yes, Sweets?\" he asked.Shelton, who came hobbling (pounding) behind Dudley, resembled his father for the most part. He was also blond, and quite round. His nose, although big, seemed small compared to the rest of his face. His ears were so small that they were nearly invisible. Every time James saw him, he was reminded of an earless elephant. Shelton wasn\\'t out of breath, though, since he got exercise from beating up the kids (such as James) at school with his group of followers.Pernella\\'s blond hair was long, straight, and stringy. Her head was so big and round that the hair failed to cover most of her neck, and although it was several inches long, it couldn\\'t even reach her shoulders. Her nose was small, and that wasn\\'t an illusion or trick of the eyes. Her eyes were beady, and her lips were thin as they covered her wide mouth. She never failed to remind Lily of one of those pigs that wins everything at the fair as long as it involved weight. She wasn\\'t out of breath, either.Aunt Evian waved the letter in her hand. \"It\\'s happened. The letter came today.\"Dudley\\'s face suddenly went pure white. \"How did it come?\"\"Lily found it in the mail. It\\'s addressed to them, too. \\'The Cupboard Under the Stairs,\\' it says.\"Shelton and Pernella eyed the two curiously, then turned to each other.\"Who d\\'you think would send ithose/i two a letter?\" Shelton asked Pernella.\"I haven\\'t a clue,\" she answered casually. \"Maybe one of the rats in the wall learned how to write!\" They chuckled.Aunt Evian went white. \"Don\\'t you dare ever say that rats live in these walls, do you understand?\"Shelton and Pernella nodded, agreeing, yet smiling in their wicked way.Uncle Dudley suddenly turned to face Lily. \"What did you do?\" he asked her harshly. \"How did you contact them? Did you-\" James moved a few inches, then a few feet, until he stood between his uncle and his sister. \"The same thing happened to your father, and look what happened to him.\"Although Lily was confused and more scared of her Uncle Dudley than she ever had been before, she heard him mention her father and suddenly felt that she needed to know more. She\\'d been told all her life that her parents had died in a plane crash at sea and that their bodies had never been found; Lily and James knew nothing of their parents beyond that. They weren\\'t allowed to ask about it or else they risked getting locked up in the cupboard. She gave in to the temptation to try and find out more. \"What about our father?\" she asked as she pushed her glasses further up her nose. Uncle Dudley never mentioned their dad. And she always wanted to know more, always hoped he\\'d let something slip.Uncle Dudley jerked slightly, realizing what he had done. \"Nothing. Let\\'s have breakfast. Then,\" he sent a quick glance at the fireplace and then a fast look at his wife, pulling at his robe around his neck as if it were suffocating him, \"then we\\'ll all go on a vacation.\"Shelton and Pernella clapped their hands together and looked at one another. They always went on trips with their dad. They were always glad to get away from their cousins, at least. \"Where are we going, Pops?\" Shelton asked.Uncle Dudley looked at James and Lily. \"How would you two like to go to New York?\"Now it was their turn to look at each other. \"We- Uh, we-\" James stuttered.\"You\\'re asking them?\" Pernella spat out, pointing at James and Lily.\"Well, of course. After all, they are part of the family, aren\\'t they? And, well, they should come with us. It\\'s for the best.\" James, who was closer to Aunt Evian, heard her mutter, \"And safer if their kind can\\'t find us.\"Under his shirt, he heard a soft hissing sound. iYour kind?/i Poison inquired.James shook his head, as if in disbelief and said under his breath, iI don\\'t know what it means, either./i\"What was that?\" Uncle Dudley asked, looking at him down his fat, oversized nose. He reminded James of an unhappy, upright elephant.\"I uh, I-\"\"Do you have that snake? In the kitchen? After I told you to get rid of it?\"Poison muttered some things in his own tongue which James knew were bad, but he thankfully couldn\\'t hear quite all of what Poison was saying. He struggled with whether or not to tell the truth as Lily looked at him desperately and Shelton and Pernella had looks of obvious amusement on their faces, and Aunt Evian\\'s had a look of growing fear and apprehension on it. Uncle Dudley\\'s remained unreadable. Apparently, Poison decided for him. The snake unwrapped himself from James\\'s waist and crawled upwards. He poked his head up through the neck of James\\'s shirt.Uncle Dudley straightened and jumped back with a small cry. James\\'s cousins stared. Aunt Evian gave a shriek and clapped her hand over her mouth right before she sank into a chair.iYou shouldn\\'t have done that/i, James told Poison.iWhat sshould I have done? He dessserved it. He dessservesss a lot more./iJames shrugged.Uncle Dudley turned to Lily, moving James away with his hand. Poison reached out for Uncle Dudley\\'s hand, but James grabbed his tail.\"And I suppose you still have that spider?\"Lily nodded the slightest bit.iIt\\'s okay. Tell him I\\'m here. I want to speak with him. Give him a piece of my mind/i, Brownie directed her.iYeah, right after you kill him/i, Lily retorted. iAnd then where would you be? Squashed on the bottom of someone\\'s shoe. And I\\'d be without a spider./iThe six waited in the kitchen for what seemed like an eternity. James and Lily moved to be close enough to hold hands. Uncle Dudley stared at them, considering. Aunt Evian made a run for the bathroom when she saw Brownie come out from under Lily\\'s hair and settle on the girl\\'s nose, waving her fangs at her husband menacingly. Shelton and Pernella sent many confused glances towards one another.\"Okay. I suppose you can keep the pests. As long as they behave. And if anything goes wrong, anything, I\\'ll lock you two- Never mind.\" Uncle Dudley paused and started to breathe slowly, obviously trying to calm himself down. After about two minutes, he said, \"Now let\\'s eat breakfast and then pack. And hurry, too.\"Everyone\\'s mouths dropped. No one, absolutely no one, had expected him to say that James and Lily would be able to keep their pets. Uncle Dudley ignored all of their looks and went to the table to begin feeling his plate with pancakes, loading them with butter and syrup.One by one, they sat down. James and Lily sat at one end of the counter, and the Dursleys crowded one another at the other end of the table.When the pancakes reached the two children, there were only two. One for each. James put a pancake on Lily\\'s dish, and then a pancake on his. Then he gave them each a small amount of the butter and syrup that was left, making sure that they both got even amounts. Lily told him how much he had left to go while Brownie informed her.Meanwhile, now that he was out in the open, Poison made himself comfortable as possible on the table, coiled like his relatives, the real poisonous snakes, always were. He made his head look as pit viper-like as possible. When he saw how much the two Potter children had to eat, and then saw how much their relatives had, he made up his mind.He uncoiled himself and in a flash, was racing Shelton\\'s fork to the stack of pancakes on his plate. He snagged two pancakes and ripped them away, dropping them on James\\'s plate.James looked up at Uncle Dudley, fearing the worst.\"Daddeeeeeeee,\" Shelton wailed, glaring at James and looking at the snake as if he were about to cry. \"That- that- that thing took my pancakes and stole them for James.\"Dudley stopped eating with his fork halfway in the air between his own stack of pancakes and his mouth. \"Don\\'t worry about it, we\\'ll get you more in New York.\"Shelton glared at James harder.iDon\\'t do that again/i, James warned Poison, who was looking smug and more so by the second as he eyed Shelton.\"Did you just talk? To the snake?\" Aunt Evian asked.James looked at her. \"I, uh, I guess so.\"Pernella eyed Lily. \"Can you talk to that spider of yours?\"James nodded for Lily. It had just dawned on him that they were afraid of them for some reason. He was going to milk it for all it was worth while he had the chance. \"And there\\'s a spider by your foot right now. Want her to get him to bite you? She can,\" he finished threateningly.Pernella jumped up and ran out of the room as Lily chewed, confused, on her pancake.\"Well,\" Uncle Dudley said, standing up and clapping his hands, ignoring the crumbs that fell from his chins. \"Let\\'s get packed, shall we? I\\'m sure I can book a flight for us.\"The Dursleys jumped up and nearly ran from the table. James and Lily got up and calmly started putting away the dishes out of habit.iYou know, Brownie told her, /ithe two of you don\\'t have to put away the dishes. iI don\\'t think they\\'ll mind/i.Lily smiled, glad to have a conversation with her pet in the open kitchen. iI don\\'t mind. I guess it seems like fun now./iiWhat do you think all that talk was about?/i James asked Poison. iIt seemed like they were afraid of us./iiOnly one way to find out/i, the snake answered calmly. iAnd that isss to get that letter, and find out what it sssaysss./iAnd so the morning went. Lily and Brownie moved on to the normal conversation, like the weather and what Brownie had heard about the latest spider family in the attic. James and Poison started talking about a Nintendo 64 game of Shelton\\'s that they\\'d like to play.center* * */center\"And you\\'re positive that she had the letter in her hand?\" Harry asked.\"Harry,\" Hermione said, slowly but surely losing her patience, \"why would we lie to you? That woman Evian snatched it out of her hand.\"\"She was in shock,\" Ron said. \"I mean, she saw the address, and it was as if she were a zombie or something. Or maybe a robot.\"Harry sighed irritably and looked to Hermione. At last, he said exactly what Ron and Hermione had expected. \"Get them here. I don\\'t care how, I don\\'t care what you do, but I won\\'t have the Dursleys do this again. Especially to my own children.\"Ron looked at Hermione and then Harry. \"Harry, you\\'ve heard the rumors. They\\'ll be easier to find at Hogwarts.\"Harry glared at him. \"Don\\'t you think I know that? Voldemort isn\\'t dead. We all know that. It\\'s a good thing the entire wizarding world doesn\\'t know about it, that\\'s for sure. But according to our sources, he\\'s searched everywhere. He knows, just as well as we do that there\\'s only one place left I would possible ever send them.\" He got up and started pacing. \"We need to get James and Lily out of there quick. Bring them somewhere safe. At least at Hogwarts they\\'ll have a chance. And they can learn magic, just like we did, so they can protect themselves.\"Hermione sighed. They all knew what they had to do, but Harry was looking worse and worse every day. Madam Pomfrey was beginning to follow him around in the halls, and even Draco Malfoy wasn\\'t sneering at him as much.\"Fine. They\\'re going to New York. To the U.S. We\\'ll go to, give them some more letters, be invisible, all that. But we\\'ll bring them back here, Harry.\"Harry nodded as they walked out of his office. \\n\\n\\nMost of the characters belong to J.K. Rowling- you know who they are. The rest are mine. Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Three \\nInvisible Screamers \\nBarely twenty minutes later, James\\'s and Lily\\'s suitcases, ratty old pieces of trash that Uncle Dudley had loaned to them, maybe two feet by three and five inches thick, were waiting by the front door. There were only two- one for James, and one for Lily. Upstairs, they could hear Shelton and Pernella arguing about what to take with Uncle Dudley and Aunt Evian. \"I want to take my video games.\" \"No, you can\\'t. You wouldn\\'t have time to play it.\" \"Why can\\'t I take my IBM computer and laptop?\" \"Because- just because. Now get a move on.\" \\nJames and Lily went to the kitchen, trying to get all the syrup off of their hands. They remained silent, hoping their Aunt or Uncle might let something slip, but no such luck came. \\nYou know, Poison offered, I could get them to tell what they\\'re hiding. He opened his mouth to show his fangs a bit. \\nLily, who couldn\\'t understand what Poison was saying just as much as James couldn\\'t understand Brownie, reached down to pet Poison\\'s head, knowing what he must be saying without understanding. \\n\"He said that he can get them to tell us what they\\'re hiding,\" James told her. \\nLily thought and then turned to Brownie. She told the spider what Poison had said. What do you think? \\nNo. Absolutely not. If they see that menace, they\\'ll punish you two beyond belief, and you still won\\'t find out what it says. \\nLily told James. \\nShe watched as James and Poison hissed to one another, obviously arguing. I jussst don\\'t sssee- the snake muttered. \\nYou don\\'t see that they could take you away from us. \\nBut- \\nNo buts, no arguing about this. We\\'ll have to try something else. \\nPoison looked thoughtful. What isss it they do on televisssion? Ah, yesss. It\\'sss called pick pocketing. Think we ssshould try that? \\nJames looked to Lily and told her. Lily consulted Brownie. \\nDo what you want, the spider said at last. But when you get stuck in your own web, don\\'t come crawling to me to get you out. \\nThey heard a rumble from upstairs above their heads. \"Honestly, Dudders, what did you pack?\" Aunt Evian bellowed. \\n\"Just some things for work.\" \\n\"Mommy? May I take my dolls?\" Lily smiled to herself. Pernella only played with her dolls when she was scared. \\nAunt Evian\\'s sigh was heard all the way downstairs. \"All right, but not all of them.\" \\nThe ceiling shook as Pernella jogged as quickly as possible to her room to get her beloved dolls. \\nTHUMP! THUD! THUNK! \\nJames and Lily looked at each other and then ran into the front hall, where the Dursleys were throwing suitcase after suitcase down from the stairs below. James darted between them and snatched his and Lily\\'s suitcases. \\n\"I hope nothing\\'s broken,\" Lily said as she quickly unzipped hers. She looked inside and then breathed a sigh of relief. \\nJames opened his and peered inside. It didn\\'t seem like anything had been broken. He felt deeper inside, where he had hidden a baseball card that used to belong to Shelton and was now very expensive. If his calculations were right, one of the heaviest packs had landed right on top of it. Please don\\'t be bent, he prayed. Finally, he felt a bit of plastic and pulled out the bag he had put it in. He breathed again as he saw that it was fine. He quickly stuffed it back as he heard Shelton yelling from above. \"No! Don\\'t throw that one! That has my laptop and Nintendo 64 in it!\" He had yelled to late, though, and the suitcase fell to the ground, sending an audible cracking sound of plastic breaking. The sound was followed by Shelton\\'s wails. \\nYou forgot usss. James turned around and saw Poison slithering towards him. \\nLily turned as she heard Brownie remark, You left me on the counter back there, young lady, and that\\'s no way to behave. Now what would have happened if I had gotten squashed? Or stuck in someone else\\'s web? Or worse, what would have happened if I had found myself in your aunt\\'s dreadful mystery dessert? \\nI\\'m sorry, Lily said quietly. \\nToo late now, isn\\'t it? I thought I\\'d taught you better. \\nJames said to Poison, Hey, I\\'m sorry. I thought you could take care of yourself. I guess I was wrong. \\nThe snake eyed him and dropped his head lower to the ground, curling himself up. You want to sssay that to my faccce? \\n\"Are you talking to your pet again?\" \\nThe four turned and saw Shelton, sneering at them. \\n\"Yes,\" James said with great pride. Now that he could talk to Poison in front of people, he wasn\\'t going to bother trying to hide it. \"Can you talk to yours?\" \\nShelton laughed cruelly. \"I\\'m not a freak. Go talk to the birds outside, DooLittle.\" \\n\"Boys? Enough,\" Uncle Dudley snapped as he came down the stairs. \\n\"But Dad, he was-\" \\n\"I know what he was doing. And don\\'t criticize him for it, either, or I swear, boy... Hurry. Let\\'s get all of our stuff and then get to the airport. We have first class tickets to New York in an hour.\" \\nIt took close to half an hour to get the backs packed in the back of the van, and they left Shelton\\'s broken laptop and Nintendo 64 inside. James and Lily kept their suitcases with them, clinging the handles tightly in their hands. \\nUncle Dudley dropped a heavy suitcase on his foot and jumped around the driveway, screaming, as Brownie retreated to hide under Lily\\'s hair, and Poison managed to tie himself once more around James\\'s stomach, nearly suffocating the human. \\n\"What was in that! That HURT! WHO packed THAT BAG!\" Uncle Dudley rubbed the sore spot on his foot. \\nAunt Evian turned around in her seat in the van and smiled sweetly at him. \"You packed that bag, dear. Remember? Your office things?\" \\nUncle Dudley quieted and looked at James and Lily. \"In the van,\" he said. \\nBefore he got in, he looked around quickly, as if watching for anyone who may have been spying on them. Aunt Evian, also, looked around nervously during their drive to the airport. \\nBrownie commented on this to Lily. I think they\\'re scared of someone. \\nI think they\\'re scared of something. \\nMaybe both. \\nMaybe us. \\nThey parked at one of the farthest possible parking places since they got to the airport so late. \\n\"Everyone,\" advised Uncle Dudley, \"hurry.\" He handed them their separate tickets, hesitating a few moments before giving James and Lily theirs. \\nWith that, everyone grabbed their suitcases, or suitcase, and ran as quickly as they could to the airport entrance. James and Lily made it first, handed in their tickets, and waited impatiently. New York! They were actually going to New York! \\n\"Anyone riding with you two?\" the man asked. \\nJames pointed at the Dursleys, who were huffing and puffing across the parking lot. \\nThe man nodded. \"Gate 32A. Have a nice trip.\" \\nJames and Lily ignored the baggage area. Their suitcases were small enough to take on the flight as carry-on. The two ran all the way to Gate 32A and handed their tickets in to the lady standing there, waiting for the last minute people. \\nJames muttered out of the side of his mouth, \"Wouldn\\'t it be funny if the Dursleys missed the flight, but we made it?\" \\nLily frowned. \"It wouldn\\'t be funny at all. We\\'d need money, wouldn\\'t we? Excuse me, ma\\'am,\" she said as she gave her ticket to the woman. \"Our relatives are being... held up. Would it be too much to ask for the plane to wait a few moments until they come?\" \\nThe woman smiled, showing all of her white teeth. \"No problem. The planes don\\'t take off right away, anyway, and there\\'s a bit of a traffic jam on the runway. So I think we can wait on them.\" \\nLily smiled and thanked her. \\n\"Poison is in my shirt,\" James whispered to her. \"I don\\'t think they\\'ll let snakes on the plane. Spiders too. Is Brownie all right?\" \\nLily asked the spider, to which Brownie responded, Of course, girl. What do you think I am? Stupid? I\\'m a spider, for Athena\\'s sake. \\nThe two children grinned at each other as they entered the cabin. \\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" James said with a bit of hesitation. \"Could you help us find our seats?\" \\nThe man took one look at their tickets and then led them to two seats in the front of the first class section. \"Thank you.\" \\nYeah, thanksss for nothing, Poison muttered as he tucked his head out from under James\\'s shirt and saw a blank wall in front of him. \\n\"Ladies first,\" James said to Lily, adding to it an elegant bow as he waved her to her seat. \\n\"Thank you, good sir.\" Lily gave a low curtsy to him before she went and sat down. As she heard the crinkle of paper, she jumped up. \"Hello! What\\'s this?\" \\nJames took the envelope from her and looked at it. \"Hey, look at the address. It\\'s \\'The Worst Seats in First Class.\\'\" \\nYou got that right, Poison muttered. \\nJames laughed and told Lily. \\n\"Poison! Really, they\\'re better than some seats. And we can move around once the flight starts,\" she told him. \\nIsss ssshe sssaying sssomething to me? Poison wondered aloud. \\nJames smiled and shook his head. He wasn\\'t going to be like a mother to his pet. Instead, he held the envelope, ready to tear it open. He looked at Lily. If she said it was okay, everyone but his family would say it was okay. \"Think we should?\" \\nLily nodded slowly, staring at the envelope so hard that Brownie had to instruct her, Careful, girl. You\\'re beginning to drool. At this, Lily straightened and said, \"We\\'d better, and quick. Or else we\\'ll never find out what it says.\" \\n\"Not to mention who\\'s writing this to us,\" James agreed. \\nHe tore the envelope open greedily. He took two pieces of paper out. He hastily but carefully unfolded the first page. \"Wait a minute. Lily? Read that. Make sure I\\'m reading it right.\" \\nCareful. Brownie poked her with one of her eight legs. There are two people standing over James\\'s chair. \\nShe didn\\'t need to look to see that no one was there. You must be imagining things, she told her spider. \\nShe took it as he handed it to her. \"Hogwarts School of Wizardry.\" She looked at him. \"Think it\\'s a joke?\" \\nJames ran a hand through his hair, even though most of it sprang back into place. He quickly rearranged his bangs to cover up his lightning-shaped scar. \"Who knows?\" \\n\"Then again,\" Lily muttered, mostly to herself, \"whoever sent this went through a lot of trouble. They find out where we live, not just that, but in what room we live in. I thought that could have been a trick of Pernella\\'s or Shelton\\'s, but then the way Uncle Dudley and Aunt Evian acted...\" Out of the corner of her eye, Lily saw Brownie climbing on the chair. \"And then they knew to find us here, on the way to New York. And look at the address that time. So either someone is stalking us, for some reason, or this might actually be real.\" \\nJames rubbed his head. \"As those Americans would say, Oh brother.\" \\n\"You know, we say that too.\" \\n\"But we always say, \\'As those Americans would say, Oh brother.\\'\" \\n\"Well, we\\'re going to America, so maybe you could drop the first part.\" \\n\"All right. As those Americans would say, brother.\" \\nLily laughed. \\n\"Ow!\" something screamed. \\nThe two children spun around, facing the invisible air. Many of the other people in the cabin turned to look, too; except that while James and Lily were looking behind them, the other people were looking directly at them. Lily flushed crimson and sank in her seat. James turned around and stuttered as he mumbled, \"Suitcase hit my foot.\" Then he, too, sank into his seat, a deep crimson in his face. \\nOn the nape of her neck, Lily felt Brownie settle back into her usual spot. See? Brownie told her sharply. There was someone there. If that brute who calls himself a snake had been paying attention, he would have seen too. She added proudly, I bit one of them. \\nLily patted the her hair gently so as not to crush the spider. Thank you. I\\'m sorry I doubted you. \\nYou mean the part where you said I was \\'imagining everything?\\' \\nYes. But could you tell me if you see them again? I think we might want to talk to them. \\nIn the name of Athena, of course. What do you think I am? Blind and stupid? \\nLily smiled and told James. \\nHe shook his head. \"A school of wizardry and now invisible people. What next?\" He took out the letter again, holding it so the two of them could read. \\nSuddenly, they heard a familiar voice that made them jump. \"Just what, exactly, are you doing? And what is that in your hand?\" They looked up and saw Uncle Dudley, laden with carryon luggage, a pile of which he had let go of so he could point at the letter the two were holding. \\n\"Uh, nothing,\" Lily said quickly, as she pulled the letter away from James. She was about to stick it in her pocket after crumpling it a bit to prove it was worthless when Uncle Dudley dropped all of his luggage and dived for it. \\nShe tried to pull it out of his reach, but he was faster than he looked. \"Give me that,\" he grated, \"or else spend the rest of your life locked in that closet!\" \\nShe slowly handed it to him. Maybe they could get another chance. Or another letter That would be even better. Nevertheless, she didn\\'t want to spend the rest of her life in that dingy hole. She didn\\'t want to spend more time there than she had to. \\nHe grabbed it, snarling, and walked off to gather up the items he had dropped. \\nShelton and Pernella came up behind him, both red in the face from the mad dash from the van to the plane. \\n\"My, my, Little Lily,\" Pernella crooned evilly. \"It seems as if you ticked off Daddy a lot. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if he locked you in that closet anyway, after the way you two have been behaving.\" \\n\"Yeah, getting those letters that upset Daddy and Mum so much. I\\'ll bet you planted them, just so you could have a good laugh.\" \\n\"Go run into a concrete wall,\" James shot back. \"Oh, I\\'m sorry. You\\'d just bounce off.\" \\nShelton gave a little humph and walked off, followed closely by Pernella, who left with a flouncing of her skirts. \\n\"Did you read any of the rest of the letter?\" James asked Lily quietly. \\nShe shook her head. \"I was hoping you had time to. I only read the Hogwarts School of Wizardry part.\" \\nJames and Lily held each other\\'s hand as a few minutes later, the plane took off. It took forever, but the final roar and the feeling of being pushed down into your seats, yet at the same time made them feel as if they were air, was both exhilarating and frightening. James would have felt more frightened, but he saw Shelton grabbing his armrests and pale as a ghost, which cheered him up a bit. Lily, also, would have been much more afraid, had it not been for the sight of Pernella holding all of her dolls close to her, screaming, \"Mommeeeeeee!!!!!\" \\nThis is about as much fun as having a bird wreck your new web, Brownie muttered in disgust. \\nI think I\\'m going to be sssick, Poison consented. \\n* * * \\n\"Well? Isn\\'t this a lovely plane ride?\" Ron asked Hermione sourly. \\n\"Oh, Ron. You\\'re just angry because that spider bit you.\" \\n\"Wouldn\\'t you be mad? The darn thing was poisonous, too.\" \\n\"It didn\\'t hurt that much, you big oaf. And besides, I suppose you made it bite you. Maybe you put your hand in its territory or something.\" \\n\"Spiders don\\'t have territory,\" Ron said sulkily. \"And did you see it afterwards? It crawled straight to her! It went under her hair, and she didn\\'t even seem to notice, much less care.\" \\nHermione clapped her hands together. \"Why don\\'t we find out?\" she asked. \\nRon looked at her skeptically. \"What do you mean by that?\" He saw her excited face and clapped his own hand over his mouth. \"Surely you don\\'t mean- talk to them, do you? Actually talk to them?\" \\n\"Well why not? I\\'ve been waiting nine years to talk to them, Ron. And now look. We\\'ve missed so much. The least we could do is have a conversation with them. Find out a little bit about them. Besides, we\\'ll have to talk to them to get them to Hogwarts and Diagon Alley, won\\'t we?\" \\nRon still looked doubtful. \\n\"All right. Look, we don\\'t have to tell them who we are. We don\\'t even have to tell them that we\\'re connected to them.\" \\nRon bit his lip. \"I guess. I\\'ve been waiting nine years, too. And I am curious. Well, let\\'s get this over with before my conscience catches up with me.\" He got up, muttering, \"Isn\\'t it your job to care about the morality of things?\" \\nShe simply grinned as he pulled on her hand and led her to the front of the plane. All of the lights were off, but the moonlight shining from outside in the night sky gave enough light for them to see the two white heads topped with the unruly black hair. \\n\"Well? What now?\" he asked Hermione. \\n\"Uh. To be honest, I\\'m not really sure. I guess I hoped so much...\" \\n\"Yeah, don\\'t worry. I know the feeling.\" \\n\"Maybe we could wake them up?\" Hermione asked hopefully. She sat on the arm rest of a chair across the aisle. Then she looked back to where James and Lily were sleeping peacefully. Lily had her head in James\\'s lap, while he was leaning back against the seat with his head slightly resting on her head. \"No. I suppose not.\" \\nThey turned back to head to their own seats. Ron caught a glimpse of the sleeping Dudley, who was so big that his round body covered the armrests on both sides of the chair, and it looked as if he might slide off at any moment. \\n\"Dudley,\" Ron said harshly between grated teeth. \"Look at him. Do you know what I\\'d like to-\" \\n\"Save it for New York, Ron,\" Hermione advised. \\nRon stared at Dudley, saying nothing. Then he slowly nodded and continued back to his seat, muttering, \"I guess he didn\\'t heed our warnings.\" \\n\"He\\'ll regret it. I\\'m not one to speak about muggles, but he\\'s-\" Hermione choked on her next few words in anger. \"How could he do that to them?\" she whispered hoarsely at Ron in the dark. \"Harry could barely fit into that room, but both of them! They get less than Harry ever had.\" \\n\"Now who gets to say, \\'Save it for New York?\\'\" Ron asked, smiling slightly. \\nHermione grinned tiredly. \"I suppose. But you can\\'t call me Ron.\" \\n\"Wouldn\\'t dream of it.\" \\nThey settled down for the rest of the trip to New York. \\n\"Where\\'s the Invisibility Cloak?\" Ron asked, whispering frantically. \\n\"Right here in my seat. I thought you might forget.\" \\n\"Gee, thanks.\" Ron turned over and fell asleep. \\n\\n\\nHi, and welcome to THE DISCLAIMER!!! (Echoes fade into the distance.) Almost all of the characters were created by the great \\'n wonderful J.K. Rowling. The rest were products of my imagination. As always, Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Four \\nUnexpected Visitors \\nUncle Dudley walked into the hotel room, beaming to himself. \"I got everything set,\" he said with pleasure. \"No one comes up here without our permission. Now,\" he said, clapping his hands. \"Let\\'s all get some food.\" \\nShelton and Pernella looked at the Potter children, who were sharing a chair and looking at the hotel suite in awe. \"Surely you don\\'t mean for them to go, do you dad?\" Shelton asked sweetly, indicating James and Lily. \\n\"Well, uh.\" Uncle Dudley started to sweat and as a result loosened his tie and undid his top button. \"I\\'m afraid you two can\\'t come,\" he told them, looking as apologetic as he could, although he\\'d be glad to have them out of their sight. \"It\\'s better for your, uh, safety.\" \\n\"We don\\'t mind, Uncle Dudley,\" Lily said sweetly. She and James had talked it over at dawn in the plane. They had to have some time to themselves to search for the letters. Truthfully, it disgusted her to have to be this nice to Uncle Dudley, but it had to be done. \\nAunt Evian ran out of the room, Shelton and Pernella following closely. Only Uncle Dudley hesitated in the doorway long enough to say, \"Room service will be up soon. Tell them to bill it to the room.\" \\nJames and Lily nodded. As soon as the door shut, they leaped up. \\n\"I\\'ll look in the closet!\" shouted James. \\n\"I\\'ve got the suitcases!\" Lily chimed in. \\nThey went into Uncle Dudley and Aunt Evian\\'s room and searched, but didn\\'t find anything. They switched positions, but all they succeeded in doing was messing up the luggage. However, they did find that Uncle Dudley had two holes in his jacket collection. \\nThey went back into the main room, panting. \\n\"We could watch TV,\" James pointed out. \\n\"And there is a nice view,\" Lily said thoughtfully. \\nIn the kitchen, they heard the sound of something being knocked over. James heard, Whoopsss. \\n\"Poison!\" James shouted, jumping up. \"I completely forgot about him. I can\\'t believe I did that!\" He walked into the kitchen. \"Oh, no,\" he moaned. \\nLily stood up and hurried to where James was standing. \"What is it?\" she asked. Though as soon as she walked into the kitchen, she knew. \\nPoison was stretched out in the middle of the kitchen floor, reclining among snack food, spilt milk, opened bottles of water, and several other foods that the Dursleys had bought for the hotel room, perfect for late-night snacks. Poison glanced at Lily and decided that she wasn\\'t worth his attention. He proceeded to dive into the Gummi Bears Shelton and Pernella had bought. \\n\"Do you still have Brownie with you?\" James asked her. He stooped and picked up a Gummi bear, looking at it from all sides. Except for a bit of butter on the ear, it looked all right. He popped it into his mouth and grinned as Lily groaned. \\nShe felt the back of her neck and then scooped up the spider to be sure. \"Yeah.\" \\nWhat? Brownie asked irritably. \\nSorry. I just wanted to make sure you were there. After what Poison did... \\nMy Athena. What has that brute gotten into now? \\nLily turned her hand around so that Brownie could see Poison, who was at that moment testing to see what Gummi Bears dipped in butter tasted like. \\n\"Gross,\" Lily muttered as she saw him swallow one greedily. \\nJust then, the doorbell rang. \"Crud,\" James muttered as he dodged past Lily. He ran to the door and threw it open. A man and a woman were wearing street robes, standing behind a cart that was loaded with plates and dishes. James could smell the delicious smell, even from under the porcelain that was covering the hot things to keep them warm. \\n\"Room service,\" the man said happily as he wheeled the cart into the room. \\nJames closed the door and looked back at them. For some reason, they weren\\'t getting ready to leave. Instead, they were eagerly watching him and Lily, who had come to stand in the doorway of the kitchen to see what was going on. \\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" James said slowly, \"but we don\\'t have any money for tips. Our uncle said to bill it to the room.\" \\nThe man\\'s eyes flashed in anger. It quieted when the woman grabbed his arm. \\n\"We aren\\'t here about that, James. Why don\\'t you come in here, Lily? We\\'re here to talk to you about Hogwarts.\" \\n\"I\\'d like to,\" Lily said quietly, \"but Poison got a mess all over the kitchen, and James and I stepped in it. I don\\'t want to ruin the carpet.\" \\nJames looked behind him and saw that he had, as a matter of fact, stepped in all of the things Poison had somehow gotten from the refrigerator, tracking splotchy footprints across the carpet. \"Oops.\" \\nThe woman smiled at the man next to her. \"Your specialty.\" \\nThe man took a stick out of his shirt. He waved it around at the footprints and said a word. Quickly, in a fuzzy flash of light and with a sigh, the footsteps disappeared. \"Bottom of your shoes, please, James.\" James obediently sat on the floor, showing the bottoms of his shoes, hoping to see more magic. The man said the word again, and James felt a vibration lift his feet like those things he\\'d seen on ER that the doctors put on the person\\'s chest to make them jump. The feeling went up to his knees, decreasing as it went. \"Now for the kitchen,\" the man muttered. He started walking towards Lily, and James got up to follow. He wasn\\'t scared of these people, and he didn\\'t think they\\'d hurt them, but just to be on the safe side... \\nStill, their voices seemed familiar somehow. \\n\"May I see your shoes?\" the man asked Lily. \"I don\\'t want you to be afraid to walk on the carpet.\" \\nLily jumped on the counter and held up her shoes to him. As she felt the pleasant tickling spread through her legs and feet, she commented, \"Brownie says that you\\'re the ones who were on the plane. The ones who were invisible.\" \\nThe man nearly dropped his wand. He and the woman looked at each other. \\n\"Who\\'s Brownie?\" the woman asked cautiously. \\n\"She\\'s my pet,\" Lily said casually. \"Sorry she bit you. She saw you watching us, and I guess she\\'s a bit protective.\" \\n\"Huh,\" the man said. He cleaned the mess in the kitchen, leaving Poison in a state of awe. \\nWhere did all of the food go? he asked James. Where are my Gummi Bearsss? \\nJames shook his head as he carried the garter snake into the living room. The woman gave a bit of a start when she saw him carrying his pet snake. \\n\"May I ask what that is and where you got it from?\" she asked. \\n\"We found Poison- that\\'s my snake- and Brownie a long time ago. Must have been, what?\" he asked, turning to Lily. \"Two or three years ago?\" \\nShe nodded. \"Two. He can talk to Poison, just like I can talk to Brownie. Is that magic? Have we been magic all along? I thought you needed spells for that.\" \\nThe woman smiled. \"First things first. Introductions. I\\'m Hermione. Hermione Granger. And that,\" she said as she pointed to the man, \"-is Ron Weasley. We went to Hogwarts with your father.\" \\n\"Our dad?\" Lily asked in a rush. \"What was he like? Was he a wizard?\" \\nShush, Brownie instructed her sharply. You\\'re making my exoskeleton ache. \\nLily settled back in her chair, embarrassed and glowing red at her outburst of asking questions. \\n\"You\\'re dad is great.\" \\n\"Wait,\" James interrupted. \"You said \\'is.\\' Our parents died a long time ago. In a plane crash.\" \\nRon sighed. \"That\\'s a trademark of the Dursleys. They\\'re what we call muggles. People who have no magic in them at all. Or at least not wizard blood. Your relatives, save your mom and dad, are not exactly good people. They\\'re afraid of magic. They did the same stuff to your dad.\" \\n\"Is our mum alive?\" Lily asked. \\nHermione and Ron looked at each other. \"Uh, no,\" Hermione said slowly. \"We\\'re having some problems in the wizarding world. There\\'s a powerful wizard, uh, warlock, named Voldemort, the most evil, strongest warlock the wizarding world had ever seen. He killed your mother. After he killed your mother, he started to come for you and your father. Your father had already worked a protection spell for himself, but you didn\\'t have one, because for that particular spell, you have to say the words yourself. And of course, you couldn\\'t speak yet, so he started doing a very complex spell that sapped the strength out of him. If Ron and I hadn\\'t arrived, well...\" She looked at Ron before she continued. \"That\\'s how you got those scars on your foreheads. After that, your dad decided that it wasn\\'t safe for you. He had us bring you to these muggles. It was hard on us all, but I think he knew we\\'d do what he asked, even if he couldn\\'t do it himself. We left you with these muggles, your only living other relatives. We knew they \\'d be mean to you; they were mean to your dad, too. But we knew that it would only be for nine years and then two months in between. We started counting the days as soon as we got back. And now, here we are,\" Hermione finished, waving her wand and free hand around at the hotel room. She looked up at Ron, searching for some sign that she\\'d done well. \\n\"How do you know our names, though?\" James asked. \\n\"Well, we\\'re friends with your father, but you two are famous, too.\" \\nThe Potters gaped. \"Famous?\" James asked. \\nWhat about \\'Famousss.\\' Poison said as he crawled out of the kitchen towards James. \\n\"So you can talk to that snake, huh?\" \\nJames looked away from the snake to Ron. \"Yeah.\" \\n\"It\\'s called Parseltongue. Your dad can do that too.\" \\nJames felt his cheeks grew warm. His dad could talk to snakes too. After knowing nothing- at least nothing true- about his father for so long, James never thought he\\'d know that. \\n\"Can he talk to spiders?\" Lily asked. \\nRon and Hermione shook their heads. \"Talk to the overflowing vat of information,\" Ron told her, indicating Hermione. \\nHermione grinned. \"Talking to spiders is a very rare gift. The chances of being able to speak Areanatu, the language of the spiders, is one in a million, if not less. I doubt anyone has been recorded as having it in the past,\" she paused and seemed to be doing math in her head before she continued, \"two hundred years. And that person, a man, upset a lot of spiders. One night they rallied together and poisoned him.\" \\nLily cringed, thinking a newborn spider she had insulted when she was little. Then again, the spider had been trying to make a home in her shoe. \\n\"Well, I think we should get out of here before those muggles come back. We have to get your school supplies.\" \\n\"School supplies?\" James and Lily echoed. \\n\"Yeah, you know. You\\'ll be first years at Hogwarts, so you\\'ll need the usual. Wands, robes, books, cauldron.\" Ron looked at them. \"Didn\\'t you read the letter?\" \\nJames shook his head. \"Uncle Dudley took it away before we got the chance to finish. All we saw was the \\'Hogwarts School of Wizardry.\\'\" \\nRon nodded slowly. \"Dear Dudley,\" he said sourly. \"If I\\'d known... What do you say, Hermione? Should we leave a little surprise for our dear friend?\" \\n\"\\'A little surprise?\\' I was thinking more along the lines of colossal.\" \\nRon grinned and looked at James and Lily. \"You two had better wait here. Wait. Do you have your things?\" They shook their heads. \"Are you packed? We can wait, I suppose.\" \\n\"We aren\\'t packed. But it won\\'t take us long, Mr. Weasley.\" \\nHe flashed her a toothy smile, saying, \"Don\\'t bother to call me \\'Mister.\\' When we\\'re at Hogwarts, it\\'ll have to be \\'Professor Weasley-\\' unless we\\'re in private, that is. And then besides that, you can call me Ron, or Uncle Ron, or whatever you like.\" \\n\"So you\\'re our uncle?\" \\nThis time, Ron laughed. \"No, no. Just a good friend of your dad\\'s. Go ahead and call me Ron.\" \\n\"Okay, Ron.\" Her mouth felt odd as the name rolled off her tongue. She smacked her mouth a few times and muttered it under her breath, looking intently at a vase. \"Ron.\" She\\'d never called a grownup by their first name before; she hadn\\'t dared. It would take some getting used to. \\n\"Same here,\" Hermione added. \\n\"Okay, Ron.\" James smiled. After all, she had said, \"Same here.\" Didn\\'t that mean calling her Ron also? \\nHermione grinned, catching on. \"Keep it up, and I\\'ll glue your mouth shut.\" \\nJames hastily shut his mouth, looking at her with suspicion. She laughed and motioned to Ron to follow her into Uncle Dudley and Aunt Evian\\'s room. \"Time to make trouble,\" she told Lily with a grin. \\nWhen they had gone, James and Lily ran to their rooms, smiling and running so fast that their pets had to yell at them to stop. As soon as they had shut the door to their room, James shouted, \"Can you believe it! We\\'re wizards! Real wizards! Going to an actual Wizards\\' school! Hog- something or other!\" \\n\"Hogwarts,\" Lily supplied. \"I can\\'t believe that we\\'re finding out about Dad! They actually knew him. Know him! Can you imagine!\" \\nJames laughed as he threw some oversized shirts into his suitcase. \\nThey walked out of the room, pets tucked into their usual hiding places, suitcases held tightly in their fists. As soon as they stepped across the threshold, they saw Ron and Hermione in the living room, talking and waiting for them. \\nHermione saw the two first. She stood up. \"Ready?\" \\nThe Potters nodded. \\nRon clapped his hands together. \"Then it\\'s off to Diagon Alley.\" \\n\"What\\'s that?\" Lily asked. \\n\"Diagon Alley is where all the magic- good magic people go to get their supplies. That\\'s where we\\'ll be going so we can get your things for Hogwarts.\" \\n\"Won\\'t Uncle Dudley and Aunt Evian worry? Or at least wonder?\" \\nHermione looked at Ron and chose to answer for the both of them. \"I, uh, think we\\'ve made it quite clear to him where you\\'ve gone.\" She grinned as she lifted her wand and shook it, sending silver sparks around the Potters, Ron, and herself. She said a word, and then the world began to spin... \\n\\n\\nMost of the characters- you know who they are- were created by the brilliant J.K. Rowling. The rest are from me. By the way, Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Five \\nShopping For Hogwarts \\nWhen her vision cleared, she saw that she, Ron, and the two Potters- James and Lily, were all in the positions they\\'d been in when they\\'d left the hotel. She looked around and was not surprised to find herself on a busy street, in the middle of a crowd of people. At first, the people looked up, surprised, but they were used to people suddenly appearing out of nowhere and soon went back to their own work. She peered at the two Potters, who were looking around them in awe. Hermione breathed a contented sigh. She still remembered what she had felt like when she had found out that she was a witch, the feeling of amazement, fear, and the expected knowledge to come had nearly overwhelmed her. \\n\"Well, Ron? What do you think? Gringotts first and then robes?\" \\nRon shook his head. \"I agree on the Gringotts part, but I think we should get the wands next.\" \\n\"Hmm.\" Hermione considered this, rubbing her chin with her wand, which she\\'d gotten into the habit of doing. She, Ron, and Harry had all gotten into the habit of carrying around their wands wherever they went. \"Let\\'s go to Gringotts first, then we can go get wands. But then we will go to get robes.\" Hermione had gotten into the habit, also, of using a stern voice whenever she told Ron to do something. \\nShe watched as Ron\\'s lips curled slightly on one side. \"Fine. And then, we go and get the books. Can\\'t do anything without books.\" \\n\"And then the cauldron.\" \\n\"Agreed. Wait! And then ice cream.\" \\nHermione smiled. \"Agreed. But we\\'ll have to hurry. I want to get back to Hogwarts and check on Harry.\" \\n\"Oh, come on, Hermione. Voldemort hasn\\'t shown up in quite a long time. What makes you think he\\'d show up in the middle of Diagon Alley?\" Ron paused as he saw Hermione glance at James and Lily, who were only half paying attention. He understood now. They\\'d talked about it with Harry. About why they needed to hurry to get James and Lily to safety. What better time to kill them than when they can\\'t defend themselves against magic? Wizards and witches from all over had said that Voldemort hadn\\'t used his full power, yet it had taken his full power for him to possess his own body. Everyone\\'s theory was that Voldemort had expected Harry to beat him again and had taken precautions, using as little as his power as possible to try and kill the Potters. Ron, Hermione, and Harry thought that he was waiting for another time to show himself at his full power, a time when it would do some good. Besides, having witnesses wouldn\\'t bother Voldemort. He\\'d kill as many people as he could in front of millions of people without even thinking of it. \"Then again, I do have to get ready for the new school year.\" Hermione looked at him gratefully. \\nThe adults led the way through the crowded streets. Ron noticed that more and more people were starting to look at himself and Hermione, and then to the two children. He felt someone tug on the sleeve of his robe, which he had donned while Hermione had put the spell on them to get them here. He turned and looked down, to where Lily was looking at him with those big, green eyes of hers. He kneeled so he could look her eye to eye. \"Yes?\" \\n\"May we take Brownie and Poison out, Ron? Or do you think people might be scared?\" \\nRon smiled to himself. He liked the way Lily said his name. He could tell that she tried not to put any extra accent on it, say it as if it were a casual thing to do and as if she did it all the time, but she always failed and ended up putting the most accent on his name. \\n\"No, I don\\'t think they\\'d be scared. Animals are a common thing to see here.\" \\nLily nodded, smiling, and then she said something that Ron couldn\\'t understand. He saw the spider that had bitten him poke her head out from under Lily\\'s mop of uncontrollable hair. Without thinking, he drew back. He hated spiders. Absolutely hated them. He watched as the spider crawled up Lily\\'s neck, across her cheek, and finally settled on her nose. She giggled and looked at him. \"Don\\'t worry. She won\\'t bite you.\" \\nRon shook his head. \"It\\'s not that. I\\'m just not a big fan of spiders. I, uh, had a problem with them when I was young.\" \\nLily nodded and said something that sounded as if she was whispering quietly to herself, but she was staring cross-eyed at the spider the entire time. There was a pause before she looked up at Ron again, grinning. The spider looked at him, seemed to wave one of her front arms at him, and then turned away from him. \"She says that she won\\'t even look at you, if it helps. She also said that you should be ashamed for being afraid of spiders. She says it your own fault for upsetting one if you get bit. She always says things like that.\" \\nThe reply made Ron grin. \"She always gives you advice like that? So, I guess she\\'s kind of the motherly type, hmm?\" \\nLily nodded as they walked, looking around her all the time. \"Yeah. My favorite is, \\'In the name of Athena, girl,\\' and then she says something else that almost always changes. But that\\'s when she\\'s in a bad mood; mostly she says things like, \\'This is better than having a bird destroy your new web.\" She doesn\\'t mean that though. She just says it. I guess it\\'s a spider\\'s sense of sarcasm.\" \\n\"Huh,\" Ron said, not sure what else to say. He\\'d never seen someone so close to a spider before. \\nLater, as he entered the bank, James noticed that something was different about this bank. He looked for the reason and saw that the tellers were so short that they needed the windows to be pulled down a bit. He looked a bit harder at the bank tellers. No, that wasn\\'t brown hair on their heads, those were their heads. \"Um, Ron? What\\'s wrong with the tellers?\" \\nRon looked in the direction of the tellers, confused about what James was talking about. What was different about the tellers? He didn\\'t see anything wrong. Suddenly, Ron laughed as he realized what was wrong. \"No, no. They\\'re goblins. Hermione says that muggles only have them in stories.\" \\n\"Ron is from a wizarding family,\" Hermione explained. \"I\\'m muggle-born. I have to tell him everything about muggles. It\\'s because he never he took muggle studies when he was in school.\" \\nRon shot her a quick grin, saying, \"Shouldn\\'t we show them the main attraction?\" \\n\"Oh course!\" a stunned Hermione replied. \"That\\'s what we came here for, anyway.\" \\nRon shrugged and shoved James and Lily in the backs to get them going a bit. They were looking around at the marble and the people and the goblins in awe. Ron led them to a teller\\'s window and greeted the goblin. \"Hey, Pete.\" \\nThe goblin looked up from his papers, grinning. \"Hey, Ron! When\\'s the next Poder game?\" \\n\"That\\'s Poker, Pete,\" Hermione corrected him. \\n\"Oh, yeah. Right.\" It suddenly occurred to Pete to look down to where James and Lily were watching him in fascination through the slot. Both had green eyes, uncontrollable black hair... They reminded him of- But surely not. He watched as one of James\\'s bangs started to slide. Before the boy could brush it back, Pete had seen the lightning-shaped scar. \"For Pete\\'s sake!\" he practically shouted. James and Lily quickly pretended to be fascinated by the white marble instead as their faces began to look slightly red. Pete looked at Ron and Hermione with his eyes as wide as they could go. \"Surely these aren\\'t-\" he looked around hastily. He didn\\'t want the other tellers to get these clients, no sirree. He leaned in closer to the window, making James and Lily move their faces away slightly. \"Surely these aren\\'t the Potters?\" he asked Ron incredulously in a harsh whisper. \\nLily felt the goblin\\'s warm breath completely cover her face. It was a nice kind of warm, though. One that she didn\\'t really mind. She felt Brownie crawl over her cheek, muttering something about saunas. \\nPete saw the freckle on the girl\\'s nose move across her cheek and under her hair. \"What was that?\" he asked her. \\n\"Brownie.\" \\n\"What\\'s Brownie?\" \\n\"She\\'s a spider. My pet spider.\" \\nPete thought about this as Ron and Hermione looked at each other. Pete had heard a lot of things about the Potters. Harry and his parents, James and Lily, had caused quite an uproar, and now these two, the other James and Lily. He\\'d heard that Harry Potter could talk to snakes. What if- \"Can you talk to that spider?\" Pete asked slowly. \\n\"Yes.\" \\n\"Pete,\" Hermione interrupted. \"Sorry to uh, well... We\\'re kind of in a hurry. If we could save the conversation for later, please.\" \\nPete nodded hastily. \"Right away, Ms. Granger.\" \\n\"Hermione.\" \\n\"Huh?\" \\n\"Her name\\'s Hermione,\" James said again. \\nHermione patted him on his back. \"It\\'s okay if he calls me Ms. Granger. Actually, with his kind, I think I\\'d prefer it.\" \\n\"What do you mean, his kind?\" Lily asked her. \\nPete snickered as he came around the counter, carrying a heavy set of keys in his hand. \"She means that I\\'m not the best of my kind. You see those other goblins there?\" He pointed to the other tellers, who were all pointing at him and finding some way to act rude. Lily nodded, looking at them but not daring to look into their eyes. \"They\\'re the older goblins. We call \\'em \\'The Elders.\\' I know, it may not seem mean to you, being a child and all. All the adults for you are elders. But with goblins, see, we\\'re going through a transformation. A revolution,\" he corrected himself, sending a quick glance at Hermione, who was pursing her lips. \"We\\'ve changed. See? I\\'m not nearly as proper as the Elders. We aren\\'t really that friendly.\" \\n\"Then how come you work here?\" Lily asked. \\nPete shrugged. \"My Elder Dad gave me the job. Said he might as well- until they get someone else, that is. Goblins around here aren\\'t necessarily pleased, but they have to put up with it.\" He grinned sadly at her. \"That\\'s the proper thing to do.\" \\nRight then, they went through what appeared to be a huge vault in the wall. Hermione and Ron went straight through. Lily looked at James, who raised his head and walked through. She looked at him. He hadn\\'t said anything to her. Not a word. She couldn\\'t believe it. He could obviously tell that she was- um. Kind of scared, and yet he went right on trying to be brave and act as if he knew everything, and he didn\\'t even take the time to say something comforting to her! She angrily went through the door behind him, hoping that it was dark so that if her eyes watered, no one would see. Quietly, She told Brownie what he had done. \\nThat\\'s men for you, girl. Here today, gone as soon as their famous. \\nYes, but I suppose I\\'m just as famous, aren\\'t I? And I\\'m not acting like that. \\nYes, girl. But that\\'s because you\\'re a girl. He\\'s a boy. There\\'s a strong difference. \\nHow so? \\nHow should I know? That\\'s just how it is. Do me a favor. If you see another spider, tell him to say hi to me. I\\'m getting lonely without any other spiders around. \\nYeah, me too. Now that James isn\\'t around to. Remember Jellyweb and Butterhold from home? \\nBrownie laughed. How could I forget? Jellyweb\\'s webs were always to thick and slippery, and Butterhold couldn\\'t keep his eight legs on a beetle! \\nHermione looked at Lily, who was smiling in the dark. Or at least, Hermione thought she was smiling. The light in the elevator was awful, and they hadn\\'t even started yet. Lily seemed to be whispering, and every now and then, she\\'d giggle. She seemed to be doing okay. Hermione shifted her gaze to James, who was peering into all the nooks and gaps in the wall he could find. \\n\"What\\'s up?\" she asked him. \\n\"Nothing. Just thinking. So is this the only bank? Is this the best one? Or what? Poison keeps saying that there are other snakes around, but they don\\'t seem to be nice ones.\" \\nRon grinned. \"That\\'s because those aren\\'t snakes. Those are dragons.\" \\n\"Dragons?\" both children shouted, snapping their heads to attention. \\n\"Yep,\" Pete said happily. He pressed a button, and the elevator started moving downwards. He shouted above the screeching sound of the air rushing past them. \"Gringotts has never had anything stolen from it. The dragons help out with that a lot. They breath fire, and I guess that discourages people.\" The elevator took a quick swerve to the right, then took to more turns at other angles in other directions. \\nNearby, James heard something hiss, Are you bad? Are you evil? Are you coming to sssteal? Huh? Are you? Are you? \\nHe shook his head as Poison muttered, Over-anxiousss reptile. Giving usss all a bad name. \\nPete finished his talk with a toothy grin, \"Can\\'t understand why, though.\" \\nThe elevator suddenly came to a sudden stop. Lily came crashing down to the ground. She\\'d been so light and the elevator had been going to fast that she\\'d been floating, almost. She grinned at Hermione and Ron, who were coming to help her up. \"I\\'m fine. That was fun, too. Can we do it again?\" \\nRon laughed. Hermione had to send him one of her prized glares to get him to stop. \"I guess I ought to hold onto you next time,\" Ron told Lily. \"Just to make sure you don\\'t go all the way to the ceiling.\" \\nPete opened the vault for them. \"For Pete\\'s sake! That\\'s all you two\\'ve got? I thought the Potters had a fortune!\" \\nHermione cleared her throat, signaling Pete to shut up. \"Their father gave them this for the school supplies. That should be all they\\'ll need for now.\" \\n\"Ah, yeah. Smart, I guess.\" Pete waited until Ron had emptied the safe, pouring all the money into a huge pocket in his robe, before he closed it. \\n\"Anywhere else?\" he asked Ron and Hermione. \\nHermione shook her head while Ron nodded. \"Yeah, I want to go to your vault to get all of those IOUs you owe me.\" \\nPete looked quickly at the control panel. \"Darn. I would, but it looks like that part of the bank is under construction.\" \\nRon grinned at the back of Pete\\'s head. \\nWhen they exited the bank, they headed up the street, to where Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions was located. \"I guess they don\\'t believe in fashion at school,\" Lily muttered. Hermione heard her and laughed. \\n\"Ron? Why don\\'t you go with James. I\\'ll stick with Lily.\" \\nRon nodded, not really caring what the plans were, for he was describing the game of Quidditch to James. \\nWhen they went into Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions store, an old woman greeted them. \"Hello, Ron, Hermione.\" She saw James and Lily. James was looking around, trying to hide the fact that he was surprised by everything and by the plump short woman. Lily, on the other hand, had already decided that she liked this lady and was grinning at her. \"Well, well, well. Look at that! I\\'ve waited for years to have the Potter children come in here again. They look so much like their father!\" \\nLily blinked and let her grin grow. James looked at the lady, slightly surprised and showing it. No one had ever said to him that he looked like his father. \\n\"Well, come on. We\\'ll get you two into some robes. Going to Hogwarts, I\\'ll bet.\" \\nThe two nodded. \\n\"Hermione, you might want to dig around in the ready made for her. I think I have something that a child outgrew before they could wear it on the racks somewhere. A size... one, I think. I\\'ll have to measure the boy, though.\" \\nJames snickered at Lily. A one! And he had to get measured, too. Boy, he never would have thought that there were so many differences between them. She was always so... excited about everything. Not at all like himself. He could let it sink in and deal with it, but Lily was always asking questions about everything she saw. It was beginning to get tiring. He was glad for an excuse to be away from her for a while. After all, they hadn\\'t been apart for years. Come to think of it, sometimes, she got on his nerves a lot. \\nHermione took Lily aside, and the two wandered over to the racks with the robes hanging up. \"So do you like your brother?\" she finally asked. \\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Lily paused. She\\'d answered automatically. Was that a good sign? She was used to the two of them being together, being able to read the other\\'s mind. That was how she wanted it. But earlier in the bank... And then the way he\\'d snickered at her just now... He was acting so... Different. \"Well, I guess he\\'s okay, for a brother and all.\" Lily thought that was a pretty good answer. After all, she\\'d overheard tons of kids at school talking about how much they hated their siblings. \\n\"But...\" \\nLily fidgeted quietly. Should I tell her? she asked Brownie. \\nYou might as well. I think we can trust her. And if we can\\'t... Lily felt Brownie tug on a strand of hair on the back of her neck with her fangs. \\n\"He\\'s just acting different. But then again, how could he not be? I mean, just yesterday, we found out we were getting letters to go to a wizarding school, and now we\\'re here, doing all of this stuff that we\\'d never dreamed we\\'d ever do, seeing all of this amazing stuff... How could he not change the slightest bit?\" \\nHermione raised her eyebrows. James\\'s character had changed more than \"the slightest bit.\" Lily went back to looking through the racks as Brownie crept back to the center of her nose. Lily managed a weak smile as Hermione said, \"It doesn\\'t look like you\\'ve changed that much, though.\" \\n\"Well, maybe we just haven\\'t noticed. Maybe it\\'s such a small change that no one really noticed.\" \\n\"But your brother\\'s was big enough to notice,\" Hermione accused. \\nLily looked back to the robes. \\nHermione stood there for a while, watching her as Lily tried to do anything that would keep her from looking into Hermione\\'s eyes. Hermione could tell that deep down, Lily knew that she was lying to herself about her brother. Her excuses were awfully lame. It was as if Lily was trying to call attention to the fact that her brother was changed, and the fact was that she simply didn\\'t want to face the truth of it. Hermione sighed and used her wand to pull out a dark black robe that looked almost as if it were new. The robe floated in the air and twirled slightly in the air. \"I think I found you a one.\" \\nLily looked at the robe, watching it swirl in the air gracefully with small pockets of air from the open windows to make the cloth ruffle and billow out a bit. As Hermione watched her, she concluded for sure that this was not the look of someone changed by their surroundings. Lily was watching the robe as it stayed suspended in the air with that same look of awe and amazement that Hermione had seen so much since that morning. \\n\"Why don\\'t you try it on?\" Hermione suggested. \\n\"Do you think I should?\" \\n\"Well, of course,\" Hermione said, managing a small laugh. \"That\\'s what they\\'re here for, after all. To be tried on. Here.\" She muttered a word under her breath and the robe fell into Lily\\'s waiting arms. \"Now go on. The dressing rooms are over there.\" \\n\"Thank you.\" Lily dashed off in the direction Hermione had pointed. \\nA few moments later, after Hermione had thoroughly disgusted herself with running through the changes in James\\'s attitude, and Harry\\'s well being, the plans she still had to make for her classes, and all the other things she still had to do, she spotted someone else walk into the door. Actually, there were four people. \"Neville!\" Hermione cried out. She raced up to him and threw her arms around him, glad to see him again. \"Are you all right?\" she said, after nearly knocking him over. \"I haven\\'t seen you in so long, though. And it\\'s so good to see you again, really. How\\'s your back?\" \\nNeville, his blush plastered on his face as if his head were a tomato, played with his wand, running it through his fingers and turning it over, a habit he\\'d gotten into when he was embarrassed or nervous. \"It\\'s fine.\" Neville looked up, smiling bashfully at Hermione. \"And this,\" he said, waving his wand to the woman next to him, \"is Hannah and her son, Doug. He\\'s going to be another first year at Hogwarts this year.\" \\n\"Really? Well, hello, Hannah. Hello, Doug.\" Hermione shook hands with them enthusiastically. Neville had come back to Hogwarts every year to visit, and Hermione, Harry, and Ron had finally gotten him to go with them to visit Hagrid, the groundskeeper at Hogwarts, also someone Neville had always been a bit afraid of. Neville hadn\\'t been the richest wizard in all the world, barely making enough money for himself and his daughter, Becky, to live. Hagrid had offered him a job to help him as groundskeeper, and she, Ron, and Harry had persuaded him to take it. Last year, though, he\\'d tried to lift something that was too heavy and had hurt his back badly. Madam Pomfrey hadn\\'t let him get up and move around in a long time. Neville had been trying to meet people for a long time now, and Hermione hoped that she hadn\\'t ruined his chances with Hannah by running up to him and hugging him like that. \\nHannah moved the slightest bit and gave the girl behind her a slight push forward. Rebecca, always shy, scooted up a few inches and stuck out her hand to her for Hermione to shake. \\n\"My word!\" Hermione exclaimed. \"Don\\'t tell me that this is Becky!\" Gently, Hermione tucked her fingers under Becky\\'s chin and raised it so that Becky would look up at her. Becky did so and saw Hermione\\'s toothy smile. Hermione had done this ever since the moment they\\'d met, and it seemed to work well. The girl offered a slight smile of her own, a bit of her shyness already dropping away. \\n\"Hello, Professor Granger,\" she said softly. Becky sent a quick glance to the boy, Doug, as an explanation. She was one of the few others who had permission to call Hermione by her first name- but only in private. \\n\"A new student is trying on robes in the back. Do you think you could check on her? After you\\'ve gotten your own, of course.\" \\nBecky nodded slowly. Shy as she was, she was always willing to help and could always be counted on to do so. She walked away from the adults and Doug quickly. \\n\"You might want to follow her,\" Hermione told Doug. \"She\\'ll show you to Madam Malkin, and then Madam Malkin will get you measured for your new robes.\" \\nDoug nodded and trotted off to catch up with Becky. \\n\"So you\\'re a professor?\" Hannah asked as soon as the children were out of sight. \\n\"Yes. I teach the transfiguration class.\" \\n\"She\\'s an animagus,\" Neville said proudly. \\n\"What\\'s that?\" \\nHermione hid a smile. Hannah was obviously a muggle. Brave of her, though, to come into the wizarding world on her own. \"An animagus is a person who can turn into an animal.\" \\n\"It\\'s very complex magic,\" Neville added. \"Only a few can do that.\" \\n\"I can become a cat, but that\\'s all.\" Neville always had a habit of making a big deal out of it. \\nNeville looked at Hannah and beamed. \"Ron and Harry- I went to class with them, too- they\\'re animagus, too. Harry can turn into a stag. And Ron can turn into an owl.\" \\n\"What can you do?\" Hannah asked. \\nNeville blushed again. \"I don\\'t really do deep magic.\" \\n\"He has a daughter to support, so we wouldn\\'t let him,\" Hermione lied. \"He wanted to, though. He wanted to fight Voldemort a lot, but we finally got him to change his mind.\" She grinned at Neville, who grinned back thankfully. \\n\"Oh. Well? What will the first years be doing at Hogwarts this year?\" \\nHermione and Neville began to fill her in. Meanwhile, James was being fitted for the robes. \\n\"My,\" Madam Malkin commented. \"You aren\\'t much bigger than a one. Smaller than a two, though.\" \\n\"Will it cost any extra to have it measured and especially fit?\" James asked. \\nMadam Malkin threw her head back and laughed. James managed a small smile. He was pretty sure that was a no. Madam Malkin supported his thoughts when she got her breath back. \"Goodness gracious, no. This will cost just as much as the other robes. All school robes for Hogwarts are the same price.\" \\nJames nodded, slightly relieved. \\nRon sat in a chair nearby, reading a newspaper. James read the headline: \"The Daily Prophet.\" \\n\"What\\'s that about?\" he asked. \\nRon jumped slightly, for he had been immersed in an article about warnings for the Dark Arts. \"What?\" he asked, still slightly taken aback. \\n\"That newspaper you\\'re reading. What\\'s it about?\" \\nRon breathed a sigh. \"It\\'s a newspaper about all the things that go on in the wizarding world. A lot of people get it. If you get the chance, maybe you could use some of that money your dad gave you to subscribe.\" \\n\"I\\'ll think about it,\" James lied. He wasn\\'t thinking about a newspaper; he was thinking about the freedom he could get here. A whole world of wizards, and he was one of them. He could get away from the Dursleys... He could live here. He could spend his money on things like magic tricks and candy, but he wasn\\'t going to spend his money on little things such as newspapers. \\nMadam Malkin came, carrying a box full of measuring tape and scissors and cloth. She began measuring him, talking about things such as what she\\'d heard the first year was like, what the weather was like, how to do things at school. All the while, James stood with his hands straight out from his sides, standing as tall as he could until he doubted he could take it anymore. He didn\\'t seem to notice that the measuring tape was doing the measuring on its own. \\nFinally, some action besides Madam Malkin\\'s cheerful, one-sided conversations and Ron\\'s newspaper reading happened. A boy walked in. He was about the same size as James, with dark brown eyes and neatly combed brown hair. \\n\"Hey,\" he said, holding out his hand close enough to James\\'s so he could shake it. \"I\\'m Doug. Who are you?\" \\n\"I\\'m James Potter.\" \\nRon looked up at him but didn\\'t say anything. Neither of boys noticed that nor the way Madam Malkin pursed her lips. \\n\"Nice to meet you. Are you Madam Malkin, ma\\'am?\" \\nMadam Malkin managed to hide her frown and smile. \"Yes I am. But you can call me simply Madam Malkin. The ma\\'am isn\\'t necessary.\" \\nDoug smiled, slightly abashed and muttered an apology. \\n\"If you\\'d kindly wait over there next to Professor Weasley, please, until I finish measuring this young man.\" \\n\"You\\'re a Professor? Neat! What do you teach?\" Doug went over to occupy the seat next to Ron, and the two of them eased into a deep conversation about magic and school. \\nJames rolled his eyes. So the kid hadn\\'t known who he was. Maybe James was thinking that he was so famous, he automatically thought everyone he met would know who he was. He had apparently been mistaken. That wasn\\'t a big deal, was it? After all, James had been in the background all his life. It wasn\\'t too bad. But he still wanted to be a bit recognized. After all, Ron and Hermione had said that he was famous. Surely they wouldn\\'t have lied to them. James moved just a bit to move his bangs out of his eyes. His hair was growing too long again. Oh, well. He\\'d just get a haircut. In the meantime, though, he\\'d just tell people his first name. There wasn\\'t any sense in diving in before he knew anything about what was going on, after all. \\nIn the other dressing room, Lily looked up as a girl, exactly her height, came into the room. \"Hi,\" she said, smiling brightly. \"I\\'m Lily. Who\\'re you?\" \\nThe girl hesitated slightly. She\\'d recognized the black hair, the green eyes, the way the bangs were covering the forehead... For a minute, she had thought that this girl, whoever it was, was Headmaster Potter. But Harry was a boy, so that took that idea right off the list. Still, the similarities were amazing. \"Hi. I\\'m Becky. Becky Longbottom.\" \\n\"Longbottom?\" Lily echoed, smiling slightly. For a second, Becky was afraid she\\'d laugh, but instead, Lily held out her hand for the girl to shake. \\n\"Are you a first year too?\" \\n\"Yeah. Except I\\'ve lived at Hogwarts for two or three years now. My dad works there.\" Becky paused. \"What\\'s your last name?\" \\n\"Potter. Why?\" \\n\"No reason. Just curious.\" No, the two couldn\\'t possibly be related. Harry would have let something slip by now. She\\'d known him for so long. \\n\"Ah.\" Lily tried to tie the robe\\'s ropes around her waist again. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever work this out,\" she muttered. \\nI can\\'t believe this. I\\'ve practically taught you since the cradle, and you can\\'t even tie ropes right. Brownie tutted at her. \\nI\\'d like to see you try this, Lily snapped back. \\nBecky stood still as stone and cocked her head slightly. What had that been? She\\'d heard Lily mutter, but that last part... Could it be Parseltongue? Harry could do that. Maybe they were related. Becky gathered up all her nerve and looked the girl in the eye. \"What was that?\" she asked. \\nLily looked up at her and remembered suddenly that she and Brownie weren\\'t the only ones in the room. \"That? Um, Pro- Hermione and Ron say that it\\'s something called Areanatu, some sort of language of the spiders or something.\" \\n\"You mean you can actually talk to spiders?\" Becky asked, incredulous. She\\'d only heard tales of such things. \\n\"Uh-huh. Hermione and Ron say that no one has been around who can talk to spiders in two hundred years.\" \\n\"Yeah, I was always told that it was pretty rare. I always tried it, though. It\\'s fun.\" \\n\"Want to try it with Brownie?\" \\n\"Huh?\" \\nLily stared at the freckle-like spot on her nose. \"Brownie is my pet spider. She\\'ll try- if she likes you.\" \\nBecky stared hard at the dot on Lily\\'s nose and realized that it was, truly, in the shape of a spider. She looked closer. \"Isn\\'t that one poisonous?\" \\n\"I think so. She doesn\\'t bite often, though. And she never kills anyone. Not on purpose, anyway. She bit Ron yesterday.\" \\n\"Ron! You\\'re kidding!\" Becky giggled. She and Ron played a game where they often tried to beat each other at different things. Put-downs, jeering, and insults were included. And unless Becky was mistaken, this counted as ammo. \\nBecky pulled on her robe over her head, thinking about the chances she\\'d have talking to a spider. It was a possibility that it would bite her, even if Lily had promised that it wouldn\\'t. On the other hand, spiders had to be threatened, didn\\'t they? She tied her ropes as she\\'d seen the kids who went to Hogwarts do. Maybe she could at least try. \\nShe looked over at Lily, who was trying time and time again to tie her robe correctly. \"Need help?\" she asked. \\nLily looked at her gratefully. \"Thank you.\" \\nBecky walked the few steps it took to reach her and took the ropes. She hastily managed to untie the knot Lily had managed to turn the rope into. \\nYou see that? Brownie asked Lily. That is someone who was born with spider in her. \\nLily giggled. \\nBecky looked up at her, searching Lily\\'s face for any sign of oncoming insult, but she saw only innocent giggling. \"What is it?\" \\n\"Brownie. She says that you have spider blood in you.\" \\n\"Spiders don\\'t have blood. They have an open circulation system.\" \\n\"Oh, I didn\\'t mean that. She says that you\\'re someone who has spider in you. I thought that meant blood.\" \\nBecky shook her head slowly. She finished tying the knot and tested it. \"You should keep it a bit loose, that\\'s what the older kids always say. And then you just stick your wand in your robe and you\\'re ready to go.\" \\n\"Thanks. Want to try to talk Areanatu now?\" \\n\"Not right now. We have to make sure these fit first.\" \\nTogether they stood in front of the mirror and modeled off their new robes, making sure they were long enough in the right places. \\n\"Now you want to try?\" \\n\"Sure.\" \\nLily and Becky sat down in the middle of the floor. Lily explained to Brownie what she wanted, and the spider grudgingly agreed to be set upon the floor for the lessons. \\n\"Okay,\" Becky said at last. \"What now?\" \\n\"I don\\'t know. Say something. Whisper it. Try to imitate how I did.\" \\nBecky obeyed. She whispered something, the sounds coming out cautiously. \\nBrownie lifted her small body on her eight legs. Tell her not to call me the fat father of a robin! she yelled at Lily. \\nLily fell over, laughing. \\n\"What did I say?\" Becky asked, in a mixture of eagerness and fear in her voice. \\nBetween giggles, Lily said, \"You called- her- a - fat father-\" Becky gasped, \"of a- robin!\" Lily fell back down, laughing harder. \\nBecky stared at her. But before she knew it, a small giggle escaped her lips. She had no clue that what she had called Brownie was bad, but Lily\\'s laughter was contagious- and it was kind of funny. She giggled again. In no time at all, they were both rolling around on the floor, trying not to squash Brownie as they laughed so hard that their sides hurt. \\nHermione ran in. \"What\\'s wrong? What happened?\" She was followed closely by Hannah and Neville. \\nLily stammered, \"She called- Brownie-\" she pointed to the spider in the middle of the floor so that Neville and Hannah could understand if they were able to make out the spider shape, \"a fat- father of a- ROBIN!\" She fell over on Becky, both of them in renewed fits of laughter. \\nThe adults failed to see what was so funny. A moment later, Ron and Madam Malkin came running, both with their wands raised. \\n\"What happened?\" Ron shouted. Madam Malkin stood beside him and slightly behind, ready to support him if there was trouble. \\n\"Apparently these three have been taken by a joke,\" Hermione told him. \"Not the crazy, hysterical, laughing kind, but pretty close. I think they\\'ll be fine when they calm down.\" \\nAlready, Becky and Lily were wiping their eyes. They looked at one another and giggled, but they didn\\'t fall over again. Hermione and Ron helped them get to their feet and then Hermione helped Lily find Brownie. \\nRight as she was handing Brownie to Lily carefully, James and Doug came jogging up. \"What\\'s up with the shouting?\" James asked, one part of his robe trailing behind him. \\n\"What kept you?\" Lily and Becky asked. Lily was glaring at James much harder than Becky was glaring at Doug. \\n\"He got a pin stuck in his arm,\" Doug said, indicating James. \\n\"Yeah, we had to get it out before we came, or else I probably would have bled to death. Do you have a problem with that?\" he spat at his sister. \\nLily considered. \"No,\" she finally muttered. \\nThe room stood silent for quite a while. James and Lily looked away from each other and became interested in their shoes. From time to time, Lily would look at Becky, who was still glaring at Doug, who was returning an equal glare. Hannah was looking at the children thoughtfully. Neville was looking from the children to Ron and Hermione. Ron and Hermione were looking from James and Lily to each other, both slightly surprised and confused. Madam Malkin stared at all of them, making sure all of the cloths fit. She had a good idea what James\\'s size was by now. \\nIn the main room, a high-pitched bell rang and echoed through the air. \"I\\'ll get it,\" Madam Malkin said. She left to take care of the new customer. \\n\"Well,\" Ron finally said, letting out a breath of air that he hadn\\'t been aware he was holding. \\nEveryone else in the room unconsciously let loose their breaths also. \\n\"I have an idea,\" Hermione said with fake enthusiasm. \"James, Doug, why don\\'t you two finish getting your robes fitted, and after that, we\\'ll go out for ice cream. Sound good?\" \\nThe children nodded without saying anything. James turned and left with Doug following closely behind him. Still without a word, everyone else followed and went into the main room. \\n\"Something tells me that this is going to be an interesting outing,\" Becky muttered to Lily. \\n\"It will be if all the kids hate each other,\" Lily answered. \\nTwenty minutes later, they all found themselves seated in the warm air at the tables in front of Florean Fortescue\\'s Ice Cream Parlor. The adults had all crowded around one table, talking about their own adult thoughts as James and Doug silently ate their ice cream trying not to look at each other, and Lily and Becky talked about the differences in the muggle and wizarding world. \\n\"I heard that you don\\'t have owls in the muggle world. You know, to send messages to other people.\" \\n\"Well, we do have owls, but they don\\'t send mail with them. We have mailmen, e-mail, and the telephone.\" \\n\"Mailmen? Do they fly?\" \\nLily giggled. \"Of course not. They drive around in trucks.\" \\n\"Oh, yeah. I remember trucks. Dad used to have a silver one. He wrecked it, though. And then we got a red one. He forgot to put the brake on with that one, and it rolled down the hill and crashed into a tree. Then he got this dark green one, but then we came to visit Harry, Ron, Hermione, Professor Malfoy, and all the others. He wrecked that one, too.\" \\n\"Who\\'s Professor Malfoy?\" \\n\"He\\'s mean. He doesn\\'t like Potters, either. I\\'d be careful with him. He teaches the potions class at Hogwarts. Hermione and Ron always warn me about going down there without someone else. I think they\\'re afraid of him.\" \\n\"I don\\'t think so. They don\\'t seem like the easily scared types. After all, Hermione, Ron, and that Harry person you mentioned fought Voldemort. And Hermione says that he was the most evil, strongest warlock ever.\" \\nBecky gaped. The silence at their table stretched until Lily looked up and saw Becky staring at her. \"What?\" Lily asked. \\n\"You said his name.\" \\n\"Whose name?\" \\nBecky squirmed a bit. \"His name. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\" \\n\"Who? Voldemort? What\\'s wrong with saying Voldemort?\" \\nBecky moaned a bit. \"You never, ever say his name. He\\'s evil. It\\'s evil.\" \\nLily sighed. \"Fine.\" \\nHermione came up from behind them. \"We need to get some wands. What do you say, Becky? Would you like to come with us?\" \\nBecky grinned. \"And I need a pet, like an owl or something. Dad said we might have enough money this year. Can we stop by the menagerie too?\" \\n\"Of course. And Lily, you might want to look, too. Who knows? You might find someone to write to this year. But you\\'ll definitely have to write to Ron and me, so I think you\\'d better think about it, hmm?\" \\nLily grinned. \"Sure.\" \\nThe group set off, the adults leading the way. Lily and Becky were right behind them. James and Doug followed behind the girls. \\n\"I\\'m sick of this,\" James told Doug, finally ready to speak to the boy. \"Why don\\'t we do something else for a change?\" \\n\"Like what?\" Doug asked, obviously not wanting to. \\nJames pulled on his arm. \"Come on,\" he muttered. He pulled harder until he led was leading Doug. Thankfully, Doug didn\\'t cry out or anything like that. James took a turn onto a street where there were less people. Of course Doug looked back to where the adults and Lily and Becky were walking away, but he didn\\'t do anything. He simply let James pull him along. \\nThey ran down streets until they were sure everything was the street they\\'d just left. Always, they took the street that had less people to hinder them as they ran. James stepped into another street and halted. The light had suddenly seemed to disappear. It hadn\\'t faded away completely, but everything looked darker and a bit more sinister. Doug caught up with him, panting and laughing a bit at the same time. He stopped when he noticed the light and shivered. The air itself was cooler by degrees. Even James turned so as not to let Doug see that he shivered quickly. \\n\"Kn- Knockturn Alley,\" Doug stuttered, shaking freely now. \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer: Pretty much all of these characters belong to J.K. Rowling. The rarely found OTHER characters are mine. Copyright 2000 \\n Chapter Six \\nKnockturn Alley \\n\"Oh, come on,\" James told him sharply. True, James didn\\'t like this place, but he wasn\\'t going to let it show as much as Doug did. After all, his dad had defeated the most powerful warlock ever, surely James could take on something like that. And this place was just that- a place. And places can\\'t hurt you. Plus, he had Poison with him. \\nPoison, James said to his shirt. You might want to wake up. \\nHe heard an ugly hiss from around his stomach and knew that this was simply a snake\\'s yawn. Night already? \\nNo. We might need help. \\nDoug was looking at him oddly. \"What was that?\" he asked, staring hard at James with wide, fearful eyes. \\nJames looked up at him, suddenly remembering that there was someone else here with him besides Poison. \"Uh, Ron and Hermione said it was something called Parseltongue. They said it was the language of the snakes.\" \\n\"You can talk to snakes?\" \\nJames nodded, smiling. \"Isn\\'t it neat?\" \\n\"Weird is more like it. Creepy, even. I\\'m leaving.\" \\nJames grabbed his shirt sleeve. \"No. We aren\\'t leaving yet. We have to finish looking around here.\" \\n\"Do you know who comes here? The Dark Lord himself, Voldemort. Just rumors, really,\" he added hastily as he saw an odd gleam come into James\\'s eyes. \"He probably won\\'t be here today.\" \\n\"Come on.\" James started pulling him away. \\nFor a while, Doug struggled to get away from here and make a wild dash for the sunlight- even if some hag did happen to turn him into a toad or dust. \"But you don\\'t understand,\" he continued to argue with James. \"This is Knockturn Alley. All the evil witches and wizards come here. It\\'s dangerous. Especially if we see Voldemort.\" \\nJames pulled him down another street, and Doug lost sight of the sunlight. He stopped struggling, convinced now that all hope had vanished along with those beautiful golden rays. \\nJames turned to him and said simply, \"Cool.\" He looked behind them to where the barrier of light and dark, Diagon and Knockturn Alley, had been. \"As long as we keep track of where we\\'re going this time, and don\\'t get lost, we should be fine.\" \\n\"Yeah, right,\" Doug muttered. \"About as \\'fine\\' as my mum\\'s cooking, that is.\" \\nHe followed James slowly and silently. Once, he saw a small, short woman walk towards them. She had a stooped back, and you could tell her gray body was wrinkled, even under the dark clothes she wore. Her face was a mask of gray skin, bloodshot, beady eyes, scraggly gray hair, and small, tightly pursed, dried-out gray lips. He quickly pulled James and himself into a doorway. \\n\"Hey!\" James hissed at him. \"What\\'s up with you?\" \\n\"I told you before. This is Knockturn Alley. It\\'s dangerous. You don\\'t want to be seen. Unless, that is, you\\'re looking for trouble,\" he added slowly. He already had a really bad feeling about this kid. He was just hoping that it wasn\\'t about to get worse. \\n\"Fine. We won\\'t be seen if you\\'re such a coward.\" \\n\"I\\'m not a coward,\" Doug retorted, \"I just want to live long enough to go to Hogwarts and turn twelve. I want to see the sunrise tomorrow, as a matter of fact. But I can\\'t do that if I\\'m dead.\" \\nJames shrugged and waited for the hag to pass. When she had, he left the safety of the doorway and went out back out with Doug following him closely. \\nThey started going into places that were more crowded. Doug, lost in his world of thought, hadn\\'t noticed this until it was too late. He looked to James with a glare that could have made something burst into flames. Then he noticed what James was doing. \\nHe was walking with a long, leisurely stride, as if he came here all the time. He held his back straight, head up, and he wasn\\'t afraid to look at anyone in the eye. He looked as if he belonged here. Doug could hardly see any trace of the James he\\'d met in Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions Shop. \\nImmediately, Doug lifted his own head and straightened his back. He forced his breath to flow in and out evenly and tried hard not to walk too fast or walk too slowly. Act like you belong, he ordered himself. \\nDoug didn\\'t see the table until it was too late. He was so concerned with making himself seem as if he belonged here that he walked straight into a table full of gruesome looking bat-raising kits and instruction manuals on torture. A few of the cages fell off the table. One or two broke and the bats flew out, squeaking joyfully at their freedom. The books and instruction manuals clamored to the ground. A few kits for experiments fell to the stone walkway, and Doug heard the high-pitched sound of glass breaking. \\n\"Oops.\" \\n\"\\'Oops!\\' That\\'s all you have to say for yourself! You\\'d better pay for that, young man. Do you know how much this stuff costs?\" the vendor shouted at him. \\nDoug stood there, shaking. He felt something pull his sleeve so hard that the force of it almost made him fall over. Instead, he landed on his left foot, and with the force still pushing him along, he landed on the right. Then the left again. Before he knew it, he was full-out running with James leading the way. They started to laugh. \\nThe laughter didn\\'t last that long, though. \\n\"Come back here, you two!\" the vendor shouted. \"You\\'d better pay for all of this!\" \\nBehind him, Doug heard a sizzling sound and then a loud BOOM! The trash can five feet away from him blew into the air, soaring as high as forty feet before it started to fall to the earth again. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the trash can land with the loud sound of metal scraping against metal like a car crashing into another, It landed black with holes all over, bent and dented in several places. \\nHe heard another soft sizzle, heard it grow louder. \\nHe stopped laughing. Then he said it quietly, just loud enough for James to hear, \"Run.\" He heard something whiz right past his ear. Doug began sprinting harder than he ever had before. When he began to pass James, James realized that he needed to go faster too. \\nTogether, they ran through the streets, zigzagging every chance they got. They could still hear the vendors behind them. \"Come back here! Or I\\'ll blow you to smithereens!\" \\nThey kept running without pausing until their sides hurt. Only then did they begin to slow down. After a while, they were walking wearily along eerily silent streets. \\nDoug waved to James to signal that they needed to stop. He wasn\\'t as used to running as James was. James had gotten plenty of exercise trying to evade Shelton and his gang. \"Do you- think it\\'s- safe- now?\" he panted, bending over so he could support himself by putting his hands on his knees. \\n\"I\\'m pretty sure- it is,\" James answered, tired, but not so tired that he had to lean over or pause that long. \\n\"Think we- can go- now?\" \\n\"I\\'d think so. I didn\\'t- know they\\'d- do that. Good thing- we ran. I can\\'t believe- you knocked over- that table.\" \\nDoug tried to shrug, and he whimpered when he realized how much his shoulders and arms hurt from pumping so much. \"Let\\'s just- get out- of here.\" \\nJames nodded. \\nDoug\\'s eyes widened as he saw something poke out of James\\'s shirt. A green snake slithered out and dropped down to the ground. \"Is that your- What is-\" \\nJames grinned tiredly and wondered if he\\'d have to explain this all the time to everyone at school. \"This is my pet snake. His name is Poison.\" \\n\"Poison? Poison? You named your snake Poison? Is it poisonous?\" \\n\"No.\" \\n\"Oh.\" Now that he knew that, Doug didn\\'t really mind. After all, It wasn\\'t that big. What was the snake going to do? Drool on him till he died? \\nBehind them, a long way in the distance, they heard, \"Come back here and pay me and I might think twice before I blow you two kids up!\" \\nJames and Doug looked at each other. Suddenly, James grinned. \"He can\\'t possibly find us. We\\'re too far away.\" \\nDoug shook his head slowly. \"They have special detectors that hunt down wrongdoers. They aren\\'t always right, though. There are so many people doing bad things that sometimes the trail gets messed up.\" \\n\"So we\\'re left with two choices. Either we can risk it, and simply hope that he got a messed up trail so we can keep on exploring, or we can get out of here.\" \\n\"I say we get out of here.\" \\n\"Agreed.\" Suddenly, what he was saying changed into an odd hissing. Doug looked at him oddly. What was he telling that snake of his? He watched as the snake muttered something in return and crawled towards James. When the snake, Poison, was safely tucked away again under James\\'s shirt, he looked back up to Doug. \"Ready?\" he asked. \\nDoug nodded, doubtful whether to be thankful for the small chance he\\'d gotten to catch his breath, or to try to make it last as long as he could. \\nThe two got ready to run and turned. Without thinking twice, they ran straight forward, looking behind them and listening hard. \\nWHAM! \\nJames bounced off of something hard. Impossible! There hadn\\'t been a wall there! He was sure of it! Yet, his glasses fell off, and he heard them hit the ground with a heart-stopping thud. He heard the glass break. He looked in front of him, where he could see the blurry image of a huge man. It looked like he was wearing something dark. He started feeling around for his glasses, turning away from the figure. Watch him, he muttered to Poison. He felt Poison obediently turn around and poke out of one of James\\'s sleeves, watching the stranger. James saw a smaller shape, obviously Doug, stoop down and pick up something. Next thing he knew, he felt something being pressed into his palms. He heard Doug tell him, \"They\\'re broken in two and one lens is broken. They won\\'t be much good at Hogwarts.\" \\nThe figure behind them roared. \"Hogwarts students!\" \\nPoison started filling in for James. The man looksss mad. He\\'sss coming. I think you might want to get up now. \\nI don\\'t think I could see enough to tell how, James muttered in reply. \\nSuddenly, he felt himself being lifted by his shirt. \"Hey!\" he shouted. Beside him, he heard Doug yell the same thing, except James added, \"Put me down, you big brute.\" \\n\"You two shouldn\\'t be in Knockturn Alley,\" the figure snapped. \"I\\'d\\'ve thought that kids these days had better sense.\" \\n\"It was my fault,\" James told him. \"I dragged him here. He didn\\'t want to come.\" He pointed to where he hoped Doug was. Or at least where a small blur moved every once in a while. \"You can let him go.\" \\n\"A little to the right,\" Doug supplied. \\nJames moved his finger obediently. \\nThe figure didn\\'t say anything. Instead, he simply started walking. The breeze his long stride created pushed aside some of James\\'s bangs out of his eyes. \"I\\'ll say!\" the figure exclaimed. \"A Potter! I would\\'n \\'ave thought that a Potter \\'d be comin\\' down here! An\\' draggin\\' others into it, too!\" The person shook the arm that was carrying the dangling James. \\nHe looksss mad, Poison told him. \\nYou don\\'t say, James muttered dryly. \\nThey walked for what seemed like a short distance. Then, just as suddenly as he\\'d felt the coldness and emptiness of Knockturn Alley, he felt the heat and fullness of Diagon Alley. \\n\"Hermione! Ron!\" the figure bellowed. \"Look who I found in Knockturn Alley!\" \\nHe dropped James and Doug. By now, James could make out the blurry image of his sister. He ran to her, stumbling at times without his glasses. When he finally did reach her, he threw his arms around her and hugged her tightly. \\nHe heard his sister gasp for air, but she returned the hug. \"Don\\'t you ever, ever, run off like that again,\" she snapped angrily at him. \\n\"Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t,\" James assured her. \\n\"Hagrid!\" Hermione shouted in delight. Then she froze. \"Where did you say you found them?\" \\n\"Knockturn Alley,\" the figure, Hagrid, said gravely. \"They looked like they was runnin\\' from something, too.\" \\nHermione put her hands on her hips. \"Explain.\" She used the same tone she used when she told Ron to do something. James, still hugging Lily, helped Doug to explain what had happened, and he said that he was at fault completely. \\nIn the end, Hermione sighed. \"Let me see your glasses,\" she ordered wearily. He handed the pieces to her, or what she thought was her, even though he noticed that she moved her hands farther to take them. \"You and your father. Always breaking your glasses...\" she muttered. She tapped the glasses with her wand and said a word. James then felt something pressed into his hands again and realized that they were actually his glasses. He put them on quickly and breathed a sigh a relief when he saw things he could identify again. \"Of course, we\\'ll have to speak to the Headmaster about this, and you may be punished, but you did tell the truth, at least.\" \\nJames nodded, still hugging Lily tightly. He was just glad to be back. Imagine! Here, wizards threw some sort of bombs at shoplifters! He didn\\'t want to admit it, but that experience had actually shaken him up quite a bit. \\n\"You know,\" Ron said, \"you might want to let go of each other soon. You two are turning blue.\" \\n\"Ron!\" Hermione laughed. It seemed like everyone was back to themselves. \"Oh!\" she cried suddenly. \"I almost forgot! Your birthday presents!\" \\nLily and James let go at the same time. \"Birthday presents? Is it our birthday?\" James asked as he looked at her. \\n\"You don\\'t know when your birthday is?\" Becky practically shouted at him. \"How can you not know-\" Lily slapped her hand over her new friend\\'s mouth until Becky calmed down. When she did, Lily removed her hand. \"How could you not know when your birthday is?\" \\n\"The Dursleys never told us.\" \\n\"My word,\" Hermione breathed. \"They were worse than we thought.\" \\nRon tightened his grip on his wand. \"Dudley,\" he said violently. \\nNeville looked slightly confused. \"But muggles don\\'t do that. Muggles- muggles-\" \\n\"You should have taken muggle studies, Neville,\" Hermione sighed. She crossed her arms, as if she were in deep thought. \\n\"You don\\'t know these muggles, Neville,\" Ron explained. \"They\\'re the worst you\\'ve ever seen. Worse than the worst muggles you\\'ve ever seen. Much worse.\" \\nHermione nodded in silent agreement. \"We\\'ll see what we can do later.\" She rubbed her chin with her wand again and then looked at her wand oddly. \"Goodness!\" she exclaimed. \"We forgot the wands!\" \\nRon raised his eyebrows. \"Now how could that have happened?\" he asked her. \\nShe shrugged. \"Let\\'s go get wands, your cauldron, phials, telescope, brass scales, and your pet for messages and such, and then we\\'ll make some arrangements so the two of you can catch the Hogwarts Express tomorrow.\" \\n\"They can stay with us,\" Becky offered. \"We\\'re staying at the Leaky Cauldron for the night.\" \\nNeville blushed and nodded. \\nHermione nodded gratefully. \"I\\'d appreciate it,\" she told them. \"Just to keep an eye on them. I\\'m sure they\\'ll have enough money left for a room of their own. And they can pay for themselves, too,\" she added quickly. Neville nodded, trying to make sure he\\'d remember, while Becky nodded enthusiastically. \"Now for the wands.\" \\nThe renewed group and their new member set off. \\n\"This,\" Ron explained, \"is Mr. Ollivander\\'s shop. It\\'s the best place to buy wands. That\\'s where I got this one.\" He stuck out his wand to show to them. \"A fourteen-inch long Yew with a unicorn\\'s hair. And it\\'s worked perfectly since I bought it in my third year!\" \\n\"I brought yer dad \\'ere too,\" Hagrid beamed at them. Hermione cast him a warning look and he looked away quickly. \\nHermione jumped in to change the subject. \"Ollivander\\'s has been here since 832 B.C.\" \\nThe two Potters gaped. \"That\\'s an awfully long time,\" James said slowly. \"That\\'s... 2,168 years.\" He looked at a single wand on a faded purple cushion. \\nHermione beamed at him. \"Exactly. Well?\" she asked, holding the door open for them. \"What are you guys waiting for?\" \\nThey stepped through the door and heard the distant sound of a bell from somewhere inside the shop. The store was narrow, with the walls covered from floor to ceiling with crevices. Lily looked inside one of them and found many sticks like Hermione and Ron\\'s wands. All of the crevices must be full of wands! Hagrid stepped into the store before Hermione and fell into the single, moth-eaten chair with a slight crash. \\nA short old man came running up instantly but stopped when he saw them. \"Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Hagrid. Hello. And who might the rest of these people be?\" \\nHermione instantly jumped up to take charge. Ron, looking thoughtful, let her and went on reading his paper. Hagrid looked at her, sighed contentedly, and sank deeper into the chair. \\n\"Mr. Ollivander, this young woman is Hannah, a, uh, friend of Neville\\'s. This is his daughter, Becky. Hannah\\'s son, Doug. And these two-\" \\n\"-Are the Potters,\" Mr. Ollivander said simply. \"They have all the marks. The hair, the eyes, and the,\" he swept Lily\\'s bangs off of her forehead for a second before dropping them back into place, \"scar. I\\'ve waited many years for another of them to walk into this place.\" \\nHe began walking along the wall, looking into the crevices from time to time. \"Now, when your father came in, we wasted plenty of time. Too much, in my opinion, especially since four of you now need wands. So-\" He stuck his hand into a crevice and pulled out two wands. \"Try these. Wave them around with your wand hand.\" \\n\"Wand hand?\" \\n\"Yes, you know, you\\'re- Hmm. Your father asked the same thing. What hand do you write with?\" \\n\"Uh, right.\" \\nMr. Ollivander shoved a wand into her right hand. \"Try that one. Holly and phoenix feather. Eleven inches. Nice and supple.\" \\nShe waved it, almost feeling as if the wand were moving on its own. She looked to Mr. Ollivander, who was looking at Hermione. He looked back at her and nodded thoughtfully. \\nHe held the other one out to James. He took it and waved it around, feeling like an idiot. \\nMr. Ollivander nodded again and then turned to Becky and Doug. \\nWithin a few moments, after trying out a few wands each, Becky and Doug found their own wands. Becky\\'s was a twelve inch maple with a unicorn hair, and Doug got a thirteen inch oak with a dragon\\'s heart string. \\nAfter they left Ollivander\\'s, James fell into step with Doug. He was still sorry for the Knockturn Alley incident, but not half as sorry as he had been before Mr. Ollivander had recognized him. \"Did you see the guys eyes?\" he asked. \\nDoug scowled and waved his wand a bit. \"I wasn\\'t really concentrating on the guy\\'s eyes,\" he said stiffly. \\nJames ignored his tone. \"There were silver- like moons, only creepier.\" \\n\"So?\" \\nJames shrugged. \"Just thought that I\\'d mention it.\" \\n\"Why don\\'t you go talk to your sister?\" Doug asked rudely. \\nJames looked ahead to where Lily and Becky were talking and waving their wands about happily. He didn\\'t understand why, but he didn\\'t want to talk to his sister anymore. \\nDuring the next hour, they finished up their shopping, and the adults and Becky led the way to the Leaky Cauldron. He kissed Hannah goodnight, and during this sickening moment, Becky tried not to blanche and throw up all over the ground. Then, to her relief, Hannah and Doug walked off. She breathed a sigh of relief when she could no longer see either of them. Hagrid thundered off a few minutes after that, and Hermione and Ron disappeared in a cloud of smoke after waving good-bye to them. \\nThey got two rooms at the Leaky Cauldron. Becky and Lily shared a room, while Neville and James shared the other. \\nBecky went to bed directly after dinner. Lily, however, was too excited to sleep. Instead, she sat in a large chair near the fire and read through her books. During breaks to rest her eyes and drink a butter beer, which Tom, the landlord, provided for her, she noticed that she could remember most of what she read. By morning, she\\'d read her books for Transfiguration, Potions, and A History of Magic. For her trip to Hogwarts, she set aside her books for Defense Against the Dark Arts and Charms. \\n* * * \\n\"And they\\'re at the Leaky Cauldron right now?\" Harry stood looking out the window, staring at the Forbidden Forest. His scar was beginning to sting, not too badly, but just enough to let him know that trouble was coming. \\n\"Yes,\" Ron said stiffly. He briefly remembered what Harry had used to be like. But now, Harry had grown up, and he was always worrying about Voldemort and Hogwarts, and what had happened to everyone around him. When Neville had hurt himself, Ron had nearly imagined that Harry might put up charms all over the school, and there were enough as it was. \\n\"What?\" Harry asked sharply. He knew what Ron was thinking of. He knew how much they all missed the days when they were simply students, and life could be simply an adventure. But now they were grown up, and they all had responsibilities, and Voldemort was their worst threat right then, and all Harry really cared about were James and Lily. Was it such a sin to want his own children to be safe? \\nHermione jumped up. \"Harry, we know it\\'s hard on you, but why must you keep them in the dark? They\\'re bound to find out you\\'re their father eventually. Not knowing could be a weakness, Harry. Are you really-\" \\n\"Hermione,\" he answered quietly, \"all I care about right now is that they get here safely. We can deal with the rest later.\" \\n\"Right.\" \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer: Most of these characters- you know who they are- belong to J.K. Rowling. The rest are mine. Copyright 2000. \\nChapter Seven \\nWelcome To Hogwarts \\nAlthough she had never been on a train ride before, she was certain that this had to be the oddest train flight that anyone had ever taken. Beside her was her new pet owl, Orion, was sitting in his cage, both of which were presents from Ron and Hermione. Becky had gotten an owl, too, and she had named hers Aldwin, and Doug had named his owl Wendelyn. \\nLily looked out the window at the countryside floating under her. She could see houses rushing past through the scattered clouds. There were only three of them in the compartment- herself, Becky, and Doug. Doug and Becky were sitting across from each other, and whatever they said had started an argument. Lily had finally given up on trying to make polite conversation after James had left with a somewhat mean-looking bunch. \\nSomeone ran through the corridor and doubled back to open their door. It was a boy with bright blond hair neatly combed and parted. He seemed to have a slight problem with saying his R\\'s. \"Hey, some kid\\'s down tha. Everybody\\'s saying that his name\\'s James Potta o somethin\\'. Do you-\" He saw Lily, who quickly smoothed down her bangs quickly. \\n\"Hey, you-\" \\n\"She what?\" Becky interjected. She knew what attention Lily might get at Hogwarts, but she also knew that Lily didn\\'t want that attention. \\n\"Hey, you can\\'t be Lily Potta, by any chance, could you?\" \\n\"What\\'s it to you?\" Doug asked. \\n\"Hey, I\\'m jus\\' saying that if-\" \\nBecky cut in again. \"Go and stare at James. He\\'s the one to be goggled at.\" \\nWithout saying a word, and looking slightly surprised, the boy left. \\n\"I think you might get a lot of that at Hogwarts,\" Becky warned Lily. Lily nodded silently. \"But don\\'t worry. The way James is acting, people will be talking mostly about him. You might get to have a normal life there\" \\nLily nodded. The thought didn\\'t make her feel any better. Maybe James would still talk to her sometimes. He hadn\\'t said a word to her since yesterday. If that was the price of a normal life, she didn\\'t want any piece of it. \\nBecky kept trying to make conversation. \"I hope I\\'m not in Slytherin. I kind of want to be in Gryffindor. That\\'s where my dad went when he went to school here. But then again, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are okay.\" \\n\"Are those the houses?\" Doug asked. \\nLily turned to them and asked, \"What houses?\" \\nBecky started to explain. \"The students who go to Hogwarts are split up into four houses- that\\'s where we stay and study. We\\'ll be classmates with the other first years in our house. Gryffindor is for the daring, brave, chivalrous people. Hufflepuffs are just, loyal, and patient, hard workers. Ravenclaws are wise and want to learn. And then the Slytherins are for the misfits. But the polite way of saying that is \\'They go to any means to achieve their ends.\\'\" \\n\"I think I\\'ll be in Gryffindor. I mean, I did go into Knockturn Alley and come out alive,\" Doug said dreamily. He\\'d been bragging about that lately, and when he told the tale now, it seemed that he purposely threw the table over on the owner just for the fun of it and then had flown expertly on a broomstick, dodging laser rays from the owner\\'s wand, with James cowering behind the trash cans. Lily hadn\\'t made any comments, but James, when he\\'d heard part where he had been hiding behind the trash cans, and given Doug a perfectly round and nicely colored black eye. Neville had gotten rid of it after about two minutes, but Doug said it still stung a bit. \\n\"What house do you think you\\'ll be in?\" Becky asked Lily. \\nLily shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t really thought about it. I mean, I\\'m not that brave, but then again, I\\'ve never had anyone to be loyal to, and, even though I get good marks in school, I don\\'t know if I\\'m that wise. And I don\\'t really want that much that I can get by any means.\" \\n\"You\\'re a Potter,\" Becky said. \"You\\'ll probably be in Gryffindor.\" \\n\"How do you know?\" \\n\"Well, your dad-\" \\n\"Who?\" \\n\"Your dad.\" \\n\"My dad was in Gryffindor?\" Had Becky mentioned that in the conversation already? Lily strictly instructed herself to pay more attention in the future. \\n\"Yeah.\" \\nLily was silent for a few moments, as was Becky, who was wondering if she should tell Lily about Harry- if Harry was in fact her dad. If Ron and Hermione hadn\\'t told her, they probably had a good reason for it, but then again, Lily deserved to know. She made up her mind to ask Ron and Hermione as soon as she could, but in the meantime, she\\'d have to stall for time. \\n\"Well, in that case, I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor.\" \\n\"Good choice,\" Becky commended her. \"Hey, Doug. Tell us the story about the Knockturn Alley incident again. We\\'ll tell you if all the changes fit together.\" \\nDoug smiled good-naturedly and began to tell his story all over, with Becky and Lily interrupting at parts to tell him what didn\\'t fit, or to congratulate him on a part he\\'d just added. \\n* * * \\nThe trio stood on the train platform along with the rest of the crowd of children from the train, standing with their owls in their cages, which were clutched tightly in the children\\'s hands. Everyone was in their black Hogwarts robes and carrying their things. Lily, looking around, could tell the first years from the older children by the amount of nervousness shown. The first years were either sticking to older siblings as if they were barnacles, or they had found other first years, and the group of them were sticking to each other like barnacles. She spotted James far off, trying to seem macho as usual lately, but she could tell that he was slightly afraid. He was standing with a somewhat mean-looking bunch. \\n\"Firs\\' years, over here!\" \\nA grin appeared on Becky\\'s face and rapidly spread into a full-grown smile. \"That\\'s Hagrid,\" she told them. \"We met him in Knockturn Alley, remember? I can\\'t wait to see him again!\" \\nLily and Doug followed as Becky led the way into a wave of other first years. \"Maybe we can go to his cabin this year. I used to go over all the time for tea and things. I\\'ll ask him\" she said again. \"His house isn\\'t the greatest, I know, but it\\'s nice in its own way, even if it does take a bit of getting used to. Harry told me that once, he and Hermione had to help him get rid of a dragon he was taking care of. He said that the cottage has never been the same ever since. I swear, Hagrid wouldn\\'t harm a fly. Dad says that one time, he even cared for a spider that, at the time, was rumored to be killing people.\" \\nLily, thinking Brownie would be glad to hear about other spiders in the area, repeated this to her. Her response, however, was not one she had hoped for. \\nHe did not! Brownie responded vehemently. Aragog never killed a single person! The whole spider population knows that! Aragog\\'s a hero, and nothing less, mind! All the spiders owe Hagrid a lot of gratitude! \\nLily let Brownie rant on as she looked around, carefully trying to keep up with Doug and Becky. She accidentally bumped into someone. \"Sorry,\" she said. \\nThe boy who\\'d bumped into her turned. Lily\\'s heart soared as she realized it was James, and she silently prayed for at least a single word of acknowledgment. Instead, he looked at her, seemed momentarily surprised, and then said, \"Oh. It\\'s you.\" \\nLily listened to the sound of her heart falling from its highest perch right onto the concrete so far down below. \\nAhead, she realized that they had approached a large black lake that had boats pulled up to the shore, bobbing slightly in the water. But the thing that mostly captured her attention was the vision beyond the lake- the building(s) with all the lights and turrets. The lights slanted across the water towards them, stretching to meet the boats and welcome them. Lily noticed that although it was velvety dark in the sky with no moon (but a few stars), she could still see the outline of the place perfectly. That must be Hogwarts, she decided right before Hagrid told them all so a moment later. Lily decided that it was beautiful and magical all on its own, and she momentarily forgot James and his group. \\n\"Four to a boat,\" Hagrid called out. James went away with his own crowd, laughing. Lily wouldn\\'t have been at all surprised to find that they were laughing at her, which didn\\'t help her mood at all. She clamored into a boat with Doug and Becky, and the three made their owls as comfortable as possible on the seats beside them. A few seconds later, the boy who hadn\\'t been able to say his R\\'s climbed in with them, looking away from them with a small, pinched mouth and sorrowful-looking eyes. As he climbed in, he set his own owl\\'s cage next to him. Lily almost felt sorry for the boy. \\n\"Hi,\" she said. \"I\\'m Lily.\" \\nThe boy looked at her with narrowed eyes. She almost thought she could read his mind for a few seconds, so clearly could she hear him thinking, Aha, I knew it. \\nBecky, with a slightly disappointed sigh in Lily, gave in. \"I\\'m Becky.\" \\nDoug stuck his hand out. \"I\\'m Doug.\" \\nThe boy considered them for a few moments and shook Doug\\'s hand. \"I\\'m Soup. Tommy Soup, actually, but evwybody calls me Soup.\" \\n\"Like... Tomato Soup?\" Doug asked with a slight smile. \\nSoup moved a bit on his bench uncomfortably. \"Yeah,\" he muttered, obviously not liking the nickname. \\nDoug apologized. \"Sorry, but- Well, you know.\" \\nSoup nodded. \"I know. My pawents wen\\'t good speakas, and my mom was usually, uh, dwunk. I guess I got the accent fwom haw.\" \\nLily nodded. \"I\\'d look out for my brother, James. He\\'s...\" \\n\"Changed,\" Becky supplied. \\n\"Exactly,\" Lily agreed. \"You\\'d be an open target for him, I must admit.\" \\n\"And for anybody,\" Doug added. \\nSoup looked down at his hands. \"He already did. Yah bwather, James, I mean.\" \\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" Lily said, truly meaning it. \\n\"Oh, you shouldn\\'t be. He\\'s the one that should be sawy.\" \\n\"Yeah, but he is my brother, even if I am-\" she cut herself off in what she considered to be the nick of time. \\n\"Even if you are getting to the point where you\\'re ashamed to say that,\" Becky finished for her. Apparently she hadn\\'t been in the nick of time as much as she had thought. \\n\"Everyone here?\" Hagrid shouted. \"All firs\\' years. All right, then. FORWARD!\" \\nThe boats began to float steadily towards the mystical Hogwarts. \\n\"Well, if you want,\" Doug said slowly, \"you can hang with us.\" \\nBecky glared at him, then thought twice and smiled at Soup. Lily was already grinning at the way Soup\\'s face immediately lit up. \\n\"Thanks!\" \\nThe boats pulled ashore and Hagrid got out of his boat first. Obediently, all the first years followed him in a tight, silent group as they walked slowly down the dirt path. Hagrid finally stopped in front of a large door and knocked loudly three times. \\n* * * \\n\"We\\'re off to another year at Hogwarts,\" Ron said slowly. \\n\"Yep. Just another year,\" Harry agreed. He ducked and looked straight ahead as Ron caught him craning his neck to get a look at the first years. \"I\\'ve been thinking,\" he admitted. \\n\"Now that\\'s a miracle if I ever heard of one,\" Ron said dryly. \\nHarry ignored his tone. Instead, he switched what he\\'d really been thinking to another thing he\\'d been worrying about. \"What if one of them is placed in Slytherin? I mean, I don\\'t mind Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw that much, but Slytherin?\" \\n\"Right. And what if Quidditch is outlawed in the wizarding world tomorrow?\" \\nHarry laughed slightly. \"Yeah, I guess you\\'re right. Nothing to worry about.\" Except what he was really thinking... \\nMeanwhile, Ron looked at his watch. \"Hermione\\'s late! Now that really is a mira- Oh wait a second.\" He tapped the watch\\'s face and watched as the hands began to move again. \"Never mind.\" \\nHarry smiled as he watched Hermione walk into the great hall to open the door. He heard her voice a few moments later, her \"teaching voice,\" he and Ron called it, as she rehearsed the speech she\\'d heard from Professor McGonagall. \"Welcome to Hogwarts. The start-of-term banquet...\" \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer: Most of these characters belong to J.K. Rowling. The rest are mine. Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Eight  \\nTaes Teliot \\n\"-will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be assorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. Your will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. \\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has its produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn you house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. \\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting. \\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you. Please wait quietly.\" And with that, Hermione disappeared, pleased with herself for getting every word right. \\n\"Like I had to hear that again,\" Becky muttered. \"Exactly the same speech, every year. Not that I would know,\" she said quickly. \"I\\'ve, uh, never been to one of these things.\" \\nSoup examined her face steadily. \"You mean that you awen\\'t allowed to come to these.\" \\n\"Basically.\" \\n\"Hey, Tomato, get out of the way.\" James and a pale boy shouldered their way into the group and left, laughing. \\n\"If he weren\\'t your brother,\" Becky said slowly. \\n\"I- We would kill him,\" Doug joined in. \\nLily didn\\'t say anything. \\nSaving the day, Hermione came back through the doors. \"Time to come in.\" After she had arranged everyone in a line, she led them through the doors. \\nLily\\'s breath was caught in her throat, and she momentarily felt as if she might be choking. The Great Hall was huge, larger than she had ever imagined. All over, there were thousands and thousands of glittering candles that evaporated the shadows. With a start, Lily realized the candles were floating in midair. Two boys at a table were trying to see how fast they could spin a set of floating candlesticks. There were four large tables where the students were sitting, laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. Hermione led them to the front of the room in front of another long table with adults, obviously teachers, sitting at it. Lily had a brief glimpse of Ron sitting next to a man with black hair and bright, anxious green eyes. Before she could get a better look, Lily turned to face the rest of the hall like all the other students. It seemed, to her at least, that everyone seemed to be staring at them. Of course, everyone was, but she couldn\\'t tell if they were looking at her or not. To avoid having to look at them anymore and find out that they were, in fact, staring at her, she looked up. \\n\"Becky, look!\" she whispered excitedly. There wasn\\'t any ceiling; the room opened up directly to the clear night sky. \\n\"Oh, that,\" Becky said as she looked up. Wasn\\'t she worried about what would happen if it rained? \"My dad said it\\'s spelled so that the ceiling reflects the weather outside.\" \\n\"Oh.\" So there was a ceiling. Lily felt better now. \\nHermione stepped forward and silently placed a stool in front of the first years. The man with the black hair and green eyes handed her a hat which she placed on the stool. Lily looked closely at the hat. It could use a good cleaning, she decided. Her eyes noticed the worn look about it, the patches, and the amount of dirt and dust that seemed to be attracted to it. What was the point of having that poor hat in this beautiful place? Hermione took a few steps back and watched the hat; she seemed to be waiting for something. \\nThe hat, odd as it might seem, moved- gave a little twitch. Then a rip formed near the brim, a rip which reminded Lily somewhat of a mouth. And then, the hat actually began to sing: \\n \\n\"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty, \\nBut don\\'t judge on what you see, \\nI\\'ll eat myself if you can find \\nA smarter hat than me. \\nYou can keep your bowlers black, \\nYour top hats sleek and tall, \\nFor I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \\nAnd I can cap them all. \\nThere\\'s nothing hidden in your head \\nThe Sorting Hat can\\'t see, \\nSo try me on and I will tell you \\nWhere you ought to be. \\nYou might belong in Gryffindor, \\nWhere dwell the brave at heart, \\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry \\nSet Gryffindors apart; \\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff, \\nWhere they are just and loyal, \\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true \\nAnd unafraid of toil; \\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \\nIf you\\'ve a ready mind, \\nWhere those of wit and learning, \\nWill always find their kind; \\nOr perhaps in Slytherin \\nYou\\'ll make your real friends, \\nThose cunning folk use any means \\nTo achieve their ends. \\nSo put me on! Don\\'t be afraid! \\nAnd don\\'t get in a flap! \\nYou\\'re in safe hands (though I have none) \\nFor I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\" \\n \\nBecky and the older children, joined by the teachers, applauded. The hat bowed to each table, and then, seemingly, to Becky as a few other first years- including Lily- clapped nervously. Then, the hat straightened and became still again. \\n\"Now then,\" Hermione began. \"When I call out your name, you will sit on the stool and put on the hat so you can be sorted.\" \\nLily sighed. \"I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor,\" she told Becky and Doug again. \\nSoup nodded. \"I just want to be somewha wha my accent won\\'t be made fun of too much.\" \\nLily pursed her lips and thought how selfish she was being. Soup was much worse off than she was. He\\'d been made fun of all his life for the way he spoke, and she had only been shunned by her brother for two days, and even then, she had friends like Becky, Doug, and Soup himself. \\n\"Well, we won\\'t make fun of you,\" she said. Soup grinned. \\n\"I just hope that I\\'m not in the same house as James,\" Doug said. \\n\"Second that,\" Becky agreed. \"No offense,\" she told Lily. \\n\"None taken.\" \\n\"Abbot, Linda,\" Hermione called out. \\nA blond girl went up to the hat and set it on her head, more or less confidently. She sat on the stool and waited, the hat covering most of her head. \\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" the hat shouted. Linda went off to the Hufflepuff table, where its members were calling her over. \\n\"Adams, Daniel.\" \\n\"RAVENCLAW!\" \\n\"Bass, Susan.\" \\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" She went to join Linda. \\nThe list went on. Lily waited nervously as the line became smaller. A boy named Michael Clark became the first Gryffindor, and a girl named Marcie Crumble became the first Slytherin. \\n\"Gilmore, Douglas.\" \\nDoug stepped forward and gave a slight smile to both Ron and Hermione, who smiled back. He tried on the hat. Everyone in the hall waited quietly. \"GRYFFINDOR!\" the hat finally shouted. Doug, grinning yet still looking slightly nervous, took the hat off and handed it to Glass, Amy before setting off to the Gryffindor table. \\nThe line kept thinning. \"Longbottom, Rebecca.\" \\nAlthough Becky nearly gagged at Hermione saying her name, (Hermione apologized with one of her looks), she went to take the hat. It didn\\'t take long before the hat shouted out \"GRYFFINDOR!\" \\nBecky turned to wave to her dad as she walked off. Neville seemed to be having the loudest cheering spasm Lily had ever heard. Hagrid was trying to get him to shut up. \\n\"Potter, James.\" \\nLily sighed as many children craned their necks to see her brother. Instantly, she heard a flood of whispers bouncing off the walls. She could have sworn that a coat of armor nearly fell off its pedestal, but the light in that corner wasn\\'t good enough for her to tell for sure. Ron and Hermione had said they were well-known, but she wished they weren\\'t this well-known. \\nJames went up, slightly nervous (as Lily was for some reason glad to see), and set the hat on his head as he sat on the stool. The Hall waited. The seconds kept going on, then the minutes started to drag. Lily\\'s heart caught in her throat. If the hat was having so much trouble placing her brother, where would it place her? Or, far worse, what if it didn\\'t put her in any house, and they shipped her back to the Dursleys as if this were all a mistake? \\nFinally the hat shouted, \"SLYTHERIN!\" James grinned and went to join his friends at the Slytherin table. Lily looked at Hermione, who seemed to have had a heart attack. She turned to look at the teachers\\' table, where Ron and the man next to him were also looking terribly white. A pale man on the far end was grinning nastily, and it was obvious that he was trying not to laugh out loud. The other teachers, including Neville and Hagrid, who were sitting with them, were all looking stunned and confused. \\nHermione finally cleared her throat (which she seemed to be having quite some trouble with) and said slowly, \"Potter, Lily.\" \\nLily walked up to the stool. She suddenly felt slightly woozy. Everyone else seemed to think it was horrible, James being placed in Slytherin. Would it be bad if she were placed there too? Would she end up in Gryffindor like her father? Maybe the hat had forgotten to mention a house for people who were completely lost and confused. \\nNow, she could see through blurry stars kids craning their necks to see her also, and she could here people saying, \"Both of them!\" and \"No one mentioned that Lily Potter was here,\" and someone voiced what she was thinking, \"I can\\'t believe James Potter is in Slytherin! What about his dad? I wonder if Lily Potter will be there too.\" \\nShe sat on the stool and gratefully put on the hat. Good, it not only covered her eyes, but most of her face as well. \\nSuddenly, she heard a small voice whisper into her ear, \"Lily Potter, hmm? My, not so difficult as your brother, thankfully. Don\\'t worry about him, he\\'s just in Slytherin temporarily. Now, then, let\\'s see. A thirst to prove yourself- your father had that also. Powerful. Very. And a brilliant mind. Memorized all those books, did you? That\\'s good. It will most surely help you. Would you rather Gryffindor or Slytherin?\" \\nGryffindor! Lily nearly shouted. \\n\"Away from your brother?\" \\nWith my friends, Lily corrected. She couldn\\'t believe she preferred Gryffindor to her brother. \\n\"Very well, then. You\\'ll be in GRYFFINDOR!\" \\nBefore she took off the hat, she heard Hermione\\'s relieved sigh, along with Ron\\'s, and over half the people\\'s in the Great Hall. She took the hat and placed it on the stool, brushing off a bit of dust as she did so. As she turned to walk to the Gryffindor table, she caught the man\\'s eyes, the man next to Ron. Her scar began to tingle pleasantly, giving her a warm feeling. She frowned for a second, wondering about why her scar was doing this, deciding she liked it, and then thinking that her eyes were like that man\\'s. She smiled at him- later on she believed that it had been one of her idiotic smiles. Nevertheless, he smiled back. \\nShe walked over to the table and sat down next to Becky and Doug. \\n\"Becky? Who\\'s that guy next to Ron?\" \\n\"Headmaster Potter. Harry Potter.\" \\nLily froze, thinking things over. Like there\\'s much to think about, she told herself sternly. Things in her mind were just now beginning to connect. She remembered her dream. \"Harry!\" someone in the dream had shouted. Harry Potter. Of course! \\n\"Becky? In Diagon Alley, Ron and Hermione said that my dad was still alive.\" She paused thoughtfully. \\n\"Yeah? So?\" Doug prompted her. Becky glared at him. \\n\"I think I know who my dad is.\" \\n\"Who?\" \\n\"Headmaster Potter.\" \\nBecky let out an excited sigh. \"I wanted to tell you about him, and how weird it is that you have so much in common and everything, but I figured if Ron and Hermione hadn\\'t told you- And besides, you figured it out on your own, so now I can tell you pretty much anything, right?\" \\nLily nodded thoughtfully, trying not to seem too eager as she did so. \\n\"I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t tell you before.\" \\nLily shook her head. \"Don\\'t bother. You\\'re right. If Ron and Hermione didn\\'t tell me, there\\'s a reason for it.\" \\nDoug shrugged. \"Maybe they forgot.\" \\n\"Hermione doesn\\'t forget,\" Becky said firmly. \\nDoug cut her off. \"Soup\\'s up.\" \\nBecky shut her mouth as Soup walked up to the stool nervously. He picked up the hat and grinned at them before it fell over his eyes. A few seconds later, the hat shouted out \"GRYFFINDOR!\" \\nLily, Doug, and Becky jumped up, cheering. Soup blushed as he took off the hat and placed it back on the stool. \\n\"Hey, do the wave,\" Doug told the girls. \\nLily laughed. Becky, however, asked, \"What\\'s the wave?\" \\n\"Well, it\\'s-\" Doug paused, trying to find the right words. \"Like this. Watch us.\" He nodded to Lily and lifted his arms, bringing them down quickly. She did the same a second behind him. \"Now you try,\" he told Becky. Becky became the third, but after twenty seconds, they decided they looked insane with only two people doing it correctly. Even Soup grinned when he saw them, trying not to laugh. \\n\"Thanks, guys,\" he said to them when he sat down next to Becky. \\n\"No problem,\" said Lily. \"We, uh, enjoyed making ourselves look like idiots.\" She grinned at him and ignored the Slytherins, including her brother, who were pointing and laughing at them. \\nWhen the Sorting Ceremony was over, Headmaster Potter stood up. \"As always, I have announcements to make.\" A few kids groaned; Headmaster Potter grinned. \"As always, the Forbidden Forest is off-limits, hence the Forbidden part in the name. Second, last year, we had a few incidents involving blown-up toilets.\" His eyes rested on a pair of older boys at the Gryffindor table while Ron chuckled and Hermione looked stern. \"No magic in the hallways. Quidditch trials are in the second week of the term. If you are interested in playing for your house, see Professor Wood. Thank you.\" At this, people at all the tables began to whisper and talk. \\n\"Harry used to be the greatest Seeker in the world,\" Becky explained. \\n\"What\\'s a Seeker? And what\\'s Quidditch?\" Lily asked. \\nBecky started filling her in. \"You should try out. You\\'d be a great Seeker, probably. But they won\\'t let first-years have their own brooms.\" \\n\"Why not?\" \\n\"Well, safety reasons, I guess. We need to learn how to fly a broom first.\" \\n\"That\\'s a pretty good reason.\" \\n\"Won\\'t you two ever shut up and eat?\" Doug asked, exasperated. \\nLily looked up and saw that the plates that had been empty a few moments ago were now piled high with food. \"This is what I call living,\" she muttered as she grabbed a bit of everything. \\n\"So you\\'re Lily Potter, huh?\" Lily looked up to see the two boys Harry had been talking to looking at her. They looked exactly identical- not to mention the fact that they looked a little like Ron. \\n\"Yes.\" \\n\"I\\'m Chris, and this is Kevin.\" \\n\"These are the Weasley twins, Ron\\'s nephews,\" Becky explained. \\n\"She pretty much took the words right out of our mouths,\" Kevin said. \\nLily grinned. \"Blown-up toilet toilets, huh?\" \\nChris shrugged. \"It\\'s really just the seat.\" \\n\"Our dad taught us how,\" Kevin added. \\n\"We have a whole collection at home.\" \\nLily looked at Becky, who nodded. \"That isn\\'t the only thing they collect.\" \\nChris shook his head, grinning, as Kevin explained, \"We also collect gum, which we put ever so carefully in the tin men\\'s joints so they can\\'t move.\" \\n\"Who are the tin men?\" Doug asked, who was listening closely. Soup nodded, but Lily got the feeling he didn\\'t like to talk that much. \\n\"Every metal figurine in this place that moves,\" Chris explained, beating Becky to it. He grinned at her. Lily didn\\'t try to mention the coat of armor behind them, which was now standing stock still innocently. \\n\"We also put rats in the girls\\' dorms. But we won\\'t put any in yours, seeing as how someone in there would tell.\" Kevin stared directly at Becky, who smiled sweetly in return. \\nThey chatted for a while as they ate, and eventually, the food disappeared and desserts seemed to appear before their eyes. \\n\"All right!\" Kevin said, grabbing a large piece of chocolate cake. A second later, another piece took its place, making the cake whole again. \\nLily surveyed the room. At the teachers table, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were discussing something deeply. Harry looked up at her, and her scar started to become warm again. She smiled widely at him. He smiled back and looked to the Slytherin table briefly before entering the discussion with Ron and Hermione again. Lily had a feeling that he was trying not to look at her. There has to be a good reason, she reminded herself. \\nShe looked at the Slytherin table, where James was talking to a ghost dressed in black, billowing robes marked with what looked like silver blood stains. The eyes were devoid of any life, not to mention the emotionless face. She got the shivers just from looking at him. How could James stand to talk to that- that abomination? \\nBecky elbowed her in the arm, more or less gently. \"Hello, earth to Lily. Come in, Lily.\" \\n\"What?\" \\n\"Where have you been?\" \\n\"I was just thinking. Why? What happened?\" \\n\"We decided about ten minutes ago to head up to the Gryffindor tower so we could get some sleep,\" Doug told her. \\n\"Oh. Okay.\" Lily wasn\\'t really that hungry anymore anyway. \\nBecky looked at her with a concerned look, as did the guys, but as she got up and walked with them, Becky started to bicker with the twins, and Doug paid close attention to the conversation, as he often did to everything, and Soup dropped back with Lily. \\n\"What weh you thinking about?\" \\nLily considered this. How could she really explain to any of her new friends what she was thinking? \"You know, I knew this friend once who had the same problem you have. The trick is that whenever you say your R\\'s, your tongue has to touch the roof of your mouth.\" \\n\"Okay.\" Soup started watching his feet when he wasn\\'t watching the things around him. \\nHoping to change the subject, and also hoping she hadn\\'t hurt his feelings, Lily asked, \"Are you looking forward to riding broomsticks?\" \\nSoup brightened. \"Definitely. It\\'ll be like all of those old tales about witches flying in fwont of the moon on Halloween and stuff.\" \\n\"Except you can\\'t do that,\" one of the twins said quickly. \\n\"Why not?\" Soup asked. Lily nodded in agreement. \\n\"Because. We can\\'t let the muggles see us, that\\'s why,\" Chris said sharply. \\n\"Why?\" \\nChris looked at Kevin. \"Too many questions.\" \\n\"First years,\" Kevin responded, trying to sound exhausted, but the smile he had on his face suggested otherwise. \"If muggles knew we existed, they\\'d want us to do all this stuff for them. Like love potions.\" \\n\"Hexes.\" \\n\"Jinxes.\" \\n\"Spells.\" \\n\"Curses.\" \\n\"Mischief making.\" \\n\"Bewitching things to act weird.\" \\n\"And the such. Not only that, but some people are afraid of magic.\" \\n\"The Dursleys,\" Lily said sourly, even a bit sadly. \\n\"Hey, you\\'re at Hogwarts now,\" Becky told her. \"It\\'ll be fun.\" \\nBy then, they were in front of a portrait of a large, ample-bodied woman. Becky had told her about the portraits on the Hogwarts Express, but she was still a bit surprised to see the woman actually move. \\n\"Teas teliot,\" Kevin said. He turned to grin at them as the portrait swung open. \"It took us a while, but we finally tricked them into using that as a password. It\\'s \\'toilet seat\\' spelled backwards.\" \\n* * * \\nThis wasn\\'t at all going the way he\\'d hoped. The way he\\'d seen it, both of them would be in Gryffindor, and both would be happy. Instead, they were separated. Even worse, James was in Slytherin. Draco Malfoy would never let him hear the end of this one. Not only that, but Lily. Every time he looked at her, and their eyes met, his scar would start to tingle. He kept it well covered with his hair out of habit. The problem was, what if Lily\\'s scar did the same thing? Did she know? Becky wouldn\\'t have told her. He had enough faith in the Longbottoms to trust them just as he trusted Hagrid- except Neville didn\\'t need drinks. But Lily would see the resemblance; she had to. James, however, (and as much as he hated to admit it) was too blind to notice Harry unless James got into trouble. Being in Slytherin, he had no doubt it would be soon. \\nIn the meantime, Harry was sick and tired of pacing in his study. Ron and Hermione had left what seemed like ages ago. Harry looked out the window and was once again amazed that it wasn\\'t dawn. \\nCarefully, he reached for the Sorting Hat. Dumbledore, or better yet, his ghost, was vacationing in the Bahamas, but he had retired, and Harry had gotten the job. That included possession of the hat, and Dumbledore had given him Fawkes as a birthday present. \\nHarry put the Sorting Hat on. \\n\"Oh, you again,\" said the now familiar voice in his ear. \\nYes, it\\'s me. Tell me, please, why you put my son in Slytherin. Harry was careful to be polite, especially with the hat. If he said anything rude, Hermione would punish him severely, and even though he was a greater wizard than her and was headmaster, he still feared her wrath. \\n\"It\\'s only temporary. Now, then. About your daughter, Lily. She really wants-\" \\nHarry took the hat off gently, but at the same time curtly. He didn\\'t want to talk about James or Lily right now. He didn\\'t want to think about Slytherin and Gryffindor. He didn\\'t want to see Malfoy, or worry about his scar, and most of all, he didn\\'t want to worry Voldemort. \\nSuddenly, Harry felt very sleepy, and he decided it would take too much energy to walk to his bed. He fell asleep right where he was. \\nSilently, Fawkes flew over and looked from the hat to Harry; then he looked out the window. Why was it that he could see the enchantment, see that Voldemort was in their mists, and everyone else refused to see it? Too bad, Fawkes thought in his own way, that his tears couldn\\'t heal the insides. \\n\\n\\nMost of these characters belong to J.K. Rowling- the rest are mine. Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Nine \\nSpiders And Malfoy \\nApparently, Becky\\'s idea of fun was different from Lily\\'s by a long shot. It wasn\\'t that she didn\\'t like her first week of Hogwarts. Actually, she rather enjoyed it. But she would have liked it a lot more it Becky hadn\\'t waited until the fifth time they got lost on the way to the dungeons for Professor Malfoy\\'s class that she pointed out Hogwarts had one hundred forty-two staircases, and that the chances were minuscule that they\\'d find the right one on their first trip to the dungeons. She had to explain a number of times to them that she had never gone to the dungeons because she had been warned not to. The first day, they found she had been warned rightly. \\nBesides that, Lily, Doug, and Soup stuck to Becky like glue until they started to find their own ways around, which wasn\\'t easy. The portraits were always moving, usually to visit some other portrait. Lily made quite good friends with many of them as she, Soup, and Doug asked for directions. Lily always made sure that the spiders left the portraits alone. \\nSpeaking of the spiders, they were truly a nightmare. James had acted so snobby that even the snakes had refused to talk to him- except Poison. Lily, however, was beginning to believe that she had a deficiency where she couldn\\'t help but be nice. She wouldn\\'t have minded talking to the spiders from time to time, or having them visit every now and then, but they most often visited her during her classes. Not just one or two, either, but whole groups of them. It seemed that the spiders were so excited about having a human to talk to that spiders from miles around were making some sort of pilgrimage. Lily tried hard to keep them out of the way during Ron\\'s class. \\nThe quartet discovered on their second day the poltergeist named Peeves, and they also found that his name suited him. Sure, what Peeves did was almost funny when he did it to someone else, but when it actually happens to you, you take a different view towards it. \\nOn Monday, their first class was Transfiguration. Becky led them all safely to Hermione\\'s classroom without getting lost, pointing out things that didn\\'t move which they could use as landmarks. Thankfully, Peeves had apparently gone off to torment Mrs. Norris, the pet cat of Mr. Filch, the caretaker. The poltergeist seemed to be having trouble tormenting the cat and owner since the two had become ghosts themselves. \\nHermione waited until the first years had entered and promptly made a lecture. \"I want all of you to know that Transfiguration will be very dangerous. There are several rules which you must learn to respect, or else I will have no other choice but to send you out of this classroom and make sure you don\\'t come back. Is that understood?\" \\nAll the students nodded their heads sullenly. Just then, a pair of first years ran through the door and quickly grabbed two seats in the back. \\n\"What happened to you two?\" asked Hermione. \\n\"We got lost,\" one of the girls mumbled. Lily recognized her as one of the Gryffindor first years from her dorm, Mandy. \"Honestly,\" Mandy continued, \"doesn\\'t anything in this place stand still?\" \\nHermione sighed. \"All right. Just get an earlier start tomorrow until you find your way, and no, nothing I have ever seen in this place stands still.\" \\nMany of the first years groaned. Becky chuckled. \\nHermione smiled. \"Don\\'t worry too much. You get used to it with time. And many of the ghosts and portraits are often happy to help. Simply remember to ask politely. Oh, and there are three doors on the third floor. The first one has to be tickled right on the top if you want it to open. The second needs to be asked politely three times. If it doesn\\'t open by then, simply tickle the wood next to the knob. The third one won\\'t open no matter how hard you try. The wall there likes to pretend sometimes.\" \\nRenewed groans echoed throughout the classroom. \\nHermione grinned briefly and then decided she needed to get to business. \"First, on everyone\\'s desk is a match. We\\'ll be turning it into a needle today, hopefully. Not all of you are expected to get this right on the first try, so no pressure.\" \\nHalfway through the lesson, when Lily\\'s match had become a metallic color and one end was pointy, Brownie crawled up on her desk. \\nMy, my, she said slowly. The other spiders have told me about this class. We won\\'t be coming to this one- They\\'re afraid that woman will turn them all into robins. Disgusting creatures. But we will all be coming to see you in your Defense Against the Dark Arts. Everyone can\\'t wait to meet you. Did you hear about James\\'s snakes? They all left. They\\'re in the Forbidden Forest now, poor things. They couldn\\'t stand your brother or Poison. Oh, and speaking of the Forbidden Forest, I\\'m going there sometime soon. Would you like to join me? \\nI\\'d like to, but we aren\\'t allowed to go to the Forbidden Forest. \\n\"What are you doing?\" another first year boy, named Will, asked. \\n\"Nothing,\" Lily muttered. Except it came out as Areanatu. \\nWill shrugged, then jumped slightly. \"Hey, there\\'s a spider on your desk.\" He pulled his leg up and started pulling off his shoe. Before she could stop him, he was bringing his shoe down on her desk as Brownie simply stood there. \\n\"NO!\" Lily shouted, grabbing his wrist. As he stared at her, his shoe dropped out of his fingers, heading straight for Brownie. Lily gasped. Then, as she watched, the shoe veered off its course and fell over the edge of her desk harmlessly. She\\'d read in her books that witches and wizards could use raw magic without spells or wands, but that had been the first time she remembered actually working any magic like that. \\nBrownie just then started to walk away. I knew you\\'d be good for something one day, she told Lily. Glad to see your using your magic wisely. See you in your Defense class. \\nLily sighed and sat down again. With a slight start, she realized the entire class was staring at her. \\n\"Are you feeling all right, Lily?\" Hermione asked, obviously concerned. \\nLily nodded. \"Yes, it\\'s just that Will was about to squash Brownie.\" \\n\"Brownie? It was a spider. On her desk, too.\" \\n\"She wasn\\'t just a spider,\" Lily said, slightly irritated. \"She\\'s a friend.\" \\nHermione sat on the edge of someone\\'s desk, thinking. \\n\"Wait a minute,\" the girl next to Mandy, named was Erica, said. \"Can you talk to spiders? Like your brother can talk to that snake?\" \\nLily nodded. She realized she had the entire class\\'s attention, just as Hermione realized it. \\n\"What did Brownie say?\" Hermione asked. \\n\"She said that the other spiders wanted to meet me and that they were coming in the Defense Against the Dark Arts class, because that\\'s the only one where they won\\'t be changed into robins.\" Lily suddenly jumped out of her seat. \"Wait a minute! Doesn\\'t Ron teach that class? He hates spiders!\" \\nHermione had realized this before Lily had, however, and Hermione was now rolling on the ground, laughing hysterically. She sat up and giggled a bit. \"Too bad you can\\'t call them off.\" She started laughing again. \\nLily frowned and started working. \\n\"Does this mean that spiders will be nesting in our dorm?\" Abby, the last Gryffindor first year girl, asked. \\n\"If you don\\'t want them to, I\\'ll ask them, but I can\\'t make them promise not to.\" \\n\"That\\'s okay. I like spiders. They\\'re cool.\" \\nLily raised her eyebrows as many other kids agreed, some looking at others first. They actually liked spiders here? Maybe it wasn\\'t so bad after all. \\n\"They also said that, well, you all know James, right?\" They nodded. Hermione stopped laughing. \"And you all know how he can talk to snakes?\" They all nodded again. \"Well, all of the snakes except Poison have left. They\\'re all in the Forbidden Forest now.\" \\nBecky shouted with delight. \"That makes my dad\\'s job easier,\" she told them. \"He always has to get snakes\\' bodies out of the owlery. But if the owls can\\'t find them, he\\'ll have a few hours off. Plus, it serves James right.\" \\nMany of the kids who had already met James nodded in agreement. Lily didn\\'t mind that much. She was beginning to feel the same way. \\nAt the end of Transfiguration, Hermione was once again chuckling- along with the rest of the class- but everyone knew that no one would be telling Ron- as long as they kept Lily away from him. Lily was the only one who had successfully changed her match into a needle- all five of them. The rest of the class had all come fairly close. Hermione smiled widely. \\n\"I see we have a very bright class. Five points for each match that looks, even remotely, like a needle,\" she said at the end of the lesson. \"We might be able to get two lessons in a day if we keep on like this.\" \\n\"Will that mean more on the exams?\" Doug asked. \\nHermione grinned but didn\\'t answer. \\nAfter this, they had forty-five minutes before their Defense Against the Dark Arts class. During that period, many of the first years told the older Gryffindors, who in turn told their friends from other houses. Everyone successfully kept Lily away from Ron so she couldn\\'t tell him, and they took Lily to eat something, carefully looking for spiders so she couldn\\'t tell them anything. Ron, however, couldn\\'t understand why Hermione started laughing every time they saw each other in the hall. Harry couldn\\'t understand it, either. \\nRumors started leaping around in no time. One of the favorites was \"I\\'ll bet that the spiders wrap everything in a web and Professor Weasley won\\'t be able to do a thing about it!\" There was also, \"I\\'ll bet the spiders will wrap up Professor Weasley and hang him from the ceiling.\" \\nThe Weasley twins were obviously thinking this was more fun than Christmas. \"Our own uncle,\" they told everyone. \\nHowever, the actual class was much better than the rumors. \\nRon, glad to escape the people in the halls who were all staring at him and chuckling, and Hermione, who by now, with hearing the rumors, collapsed where she was in fits of laughter that brought tears to her eyes, sat down in his room fifteen minutes before the start of class. Looking up after collapsing in his chair, he saw all of the first year Gryffindors already there. He looked for Lily and Becky and saw them sitting in the back of the classroom. \\n\"Is everyone here?\" he asked. If they were, they might as well simply get a start on the lesson. Odd how they were all here early and sitting at their desks silently. \\nSeveral of them nodded. Lily looked apologetic, but, not wanting to act like he was favoring her, he wasn\\'t looking at her at all. \\n\"All right. Everyone take out their books.\" He was surprised to see that they already had them on their desks. \"Okay, then. Turn to page one. We\\'ll be starting with griffins. Now then. All of you who have come from wizarding families probably know that in the presence of a griffin, you can\\'t tell a lie. For witches and wizards, this can be a bit of a problem, since muggles can\\'t find out we exist. Thankfully, there are things we can do to keep the griffins from affecting us. One way is by using charms- You\\'ll have to talk to Professor Welts about that. But you can also...\" \\nLily noticed something on the floor and heard Brownie say, We\\'re here. Every spider in Hogwarts. \\nLily knocked her quill onto the floor and bent to pick it up so she could be closer to the crack Brownie was beginning to crawl out of. Areanatu carried a long way, but she didn\\'t want anyone else to notice what she was doing. She knew perfectly well everyone didn\\'t want her to call off the \"joke\" on Ron. \\nStay there, she whispered. Don\\'t- She felt something cover her mouth and turned to see Becky there, glaring at her and holding a hand over her mouth. \\nBecky shook her head. \\nBrownie, however, hadn\\'t caught on. What do you mean stay here? I have the entire spider population of Hogwarts here! We\\'re coming in. \\nLily watched as spiders ran through the crack like a wave, with Brownie sitting on her fallen quill and waving her arms triumphantly. Mandy turned to see what was happening and gasped; then the rest of the class, including Ron, turned to see what was going on, and everyone gasped. Ron jumped on his desk, but everyone was too busy watching the spiders as they climbed the furniture, walls, and ceiling. Some people were even covered with spiders. As soon as Becky let go, Lily commanded them to get off the people and sit somewhere else. \\nThe spiders started to talking all at once, all of them trying to get Lily\\'s attention and introduce themselves. They all mentioned a few million times that they\\'d never had a human to talk to before. \\nThe room started to get crowded as more and more spiders entered through cracks. The surge started moving towards Ron as he stared at them, horrified. \\nLily jumped up. Stop! she shouted as loudly as she could. All the spiders froze. Now, Lily said as she realized she had everyone\\'s- spiders\\' and humans\\' attention- I know this is the safest place class for you to come and see me, but this isn\\'t the best time. My teacher is afraid of spiders. \\nAfraid of spiders! a few shouted. Why is he afraid of spiders? We wouldn\\'t hurt him unless he hurt us first! Many spiders turned to shake their fangs at Ron, who was pouring sweat and shaking horribly, the spiders thinking he had done something to one of them. \\nI don\\'t know how, but he won\\'t kill you. You will, however, give him a heart attack. He\\'s a good person, and perhaps you could come to my house later on- Gryffindor- to visit. No one there is afraid of spiders. \\nHey! I know where Gryffindor is! shouted a spider. Lily grinned. He was obviously one of the younger ones. \\nWe all know where the Gryffindor house is, several spiders snapped back at him. \\nLily grinned as they started to agree and looked at Ron. \"I\\'m sorry, Professor, really, I am. You see, Brownie came to me during Transfiguration, and said that they were coming in our Defense Against the Dark Arts class. By the time I realized you taught that class, it was too late. I tried to call it off, but I couldn\\'t talk to the spiders, and I... couldn\\'t get to you.\" \\nRon thought about this shakily. No wonder everyone had been watching him and laughing at him in the halls. And why Hermione- Ron was so mad at Hermione that he nearly snapped his wand in half. \\nHe looked at Lily, who was looking nervous. She was like Harry more than either of them knew. Harry wouldn\\'t have come right out and said, \"People were trying to keep me away from you and the spiders so I couldn\\'t tell anyone\" either. \\n\"It\\'s okay, Ms. Potter. I think I understand. Um, but could you please call them off? They\\'re a little... distracting.\" \\n\"Yes, sir.\" Lily told the spiders that Ron wanted them to leave so he could teach. \\nBrownie walked onto her desk. We don\\'t want to leave, she said firmly. So we won\\'t. \\nLily told Ron with sigh. \"I\\'m sorry, sir, but that\\'s the bad thing about spiders. They won\\'t do anything they don\\'t want to do.\" \\nRon nodded. \"Can\\'t you make them?\" \\nLily shook her head. \"I\\'m sorry, sir, but I can\\'t.\" \\nThe class waited while everyone thought of something. Ron and Lily tried to think of some way to get the spiders to leave while the rest of the class tried to think of some way to keep the spiders from leaving. \\nSuddenly, the pale man Lily had seen at the teachers\\' table the night before crashed through the doorway, dragging the Weasley twins behind him. \\n\"That\\'s Professor Malfoy,\" Becky whispered to Lily. Lily nodded. She could see why they had been warned not to go to see him alone. \\n\"Weasley- I mean, Professor Weasley,\" was it just Lily, or had he said \"professor\" with just the slightest sneer? \"What is the meaning of this?\" \\n\"What is the meaning of what, Professor Malfoy?\" \\n\"Nearly half of the students from Hogwarts are gathered in the hall outside your door!\" \\n\"Oh, that. We were having an unexpected lesson today.\" Ron waving his wand, indicating all of the spiders that had covered the room in colors from black to brown with a few specks of white, red, and yellow. \\nMalfoy looked at the colors and realized that they were caused by thousands- no, millions of spiders. His jaw dropped. \"That Potter girl, I suppose,\" he muttered to Ron. \\nRon simply glared at him. \\nDo me a favor, Lily asked. Although she couldn\\'t hear it, she could tell that the sound was carried around the room, although her whispering was only audible to Becky, Doug, and perhaps Soup and the first years in front of her. \\nWhat is it? Brownie asked. \\nA man just walked in. On your way out, could you please... I don\\'t know... \\nAttack him? Brownie offered hopefully. \\nJust don\\'t kill him, Lily ordered. She hadn\\'t met Malfoy one on one, but she already didn\\'t like him. And she definitely didn\\'t appreciate the way he was talking to and looking at Ron. \\nThe surge of spiders moved as one. Ron jumped, but stood his ground, looking at Lily a bit fearfully. She winked at him and pointed at Malfoy. A nasty grin began to spread on Ron\\'s face. Chris and Kevin stood, frozen to were they stood as they watched the spiders swarm towards them. They looked at each other uncertainly and then looked to Lily, who winked at them also. She pointed to Malfoy again. The twins grinned at each other and took a few steps to get as far away from Malfoy as they could. Kids were crowding the door, trying to see what was happening, and then quickly turning to run when they saw the spiders heading for them. Malfoy was frozen to the spot, a look of pure terror on his face. \\nThe spiders reached him and stopped as they surrounded him. After a few seconds, he started moving again, trying to stomp on the spiders. \"NO!\" Lily screamed. \\nThe spiders, however, had apparently expected this. \\nDon\\'t worry, Brownie told Lily. He\\'s tried to stomp them before. \\nThe spiders, undaunted, started climbing up his leg- inside the robe and out. Malfoy started hopping around, batting uselessly at his robes. Lily began to notice thin, fine lines start to cover his robes, and Malfoy didn\\'t seem able to move as much. Ron had fallen on the ground, much like Hermione, and was shaking with laughter. The twins were chuckling in between giving each other high fives and giving Lily the thumbs-up sign. A few kids were poking their heads through the door again. \\nMalfoy danced/ran/hopped out of the classroom down the hall, yelling. The spiders were hot on his trail. Lily could hear them all laughing. Ron quickly followed him, chuckling, and knowing that he would have to stand up for Lily when Malfoy told his version of the story to Harry. \\nBrownie had stayed on Lily\\'s desk. Thank you, Lily told her. \\nBrownie retorted, Don\\'t mention it. They haven\\'t had this much fun in years. Now, if you excuse me, I need to go join the fun, she said as she climbed down Lily\\'s desk and across the floor. Who knows? We might make this a tradition. Awful man, he is. I say once a week will do quite nicely. Maybe we\\'ll get him in his sleep next time. Tie him to his bed. Athena knows why humans sleep on those things. \\nLily chuckled. \\nA few moments later, a bunch of Slytherins walked into the room. James was in the lead. He marched right up to Lily. \\n\"Why did you do that?\" \\n\"What did I do?\" Lily asked rudely. \"It was the spiders, not me. They wanted to do that to him. He\\'s awful.\" \\n\"No, he isn\\'t. Professor Malfoy is great.\" \\nBecky doubled over with laughter. \\n\"I hope they expel you,\" James spat out at Lily. \"The next time you pull a stunt like that I\\'ll-\" \\n\"Sick Poison on her?\" Becky cut in. \"Brownie told us that all the snakes except Poison left because they couldn\\'t stand you. Poison isn\\'t even poisonous. He\\'s a garter snake. Perfectly harmless.\" \\n\"He has a few tricks.\" \\n\"Yeah, like wrapping up around your ankle and refusing to let go. Or drooling on you. Hey, yeah, that\\'s it. Poison could drown someone with his drool.\" \\n\"He doesn\\'t have to take that from you!\" a Slytherin shouted at her. \\nDoug jumped up and stood and stood in front of James. \"He has to take it if he doesn\\'t get out of our faces.\" \\n\"POTTER!\" \\nLily and James turned to see who it was. Malfoy had freed himself of the webbing and had shaken off the spiders. Ron was standing behind him, looking thoughtful \\n\"Yes sir?\" James and Lily asked at the same time. \\n\"Not you James, you may join the rest of your class. Ms. Potter. The headmaster would like to talk to you.\" \\nLily gasped quickly. She\\'d never been in trouble before. How could- She felt her cheeks grow warm with anger. Professor Malfoy! How dare he?! She stood promptly and marched down the stairs, being comforted by the sympathetic looks of her classmates, Ron, and the Weasley twins. \\n\"I hope to see you in my class later on,\" Malfoy told her in a low and cruel voice., \"To say good-bye to your friends and with your bags packed, that is.\" The Slytherins sneered. \\nRon looked to the twins, \"Show her to the headmaster\\'s, will you?\" \\n\"That isn\\'t necessary,\" Malfoy said. \"James, please escort your sister to the headmaster\\'s office.\" He sneered at Ron. \"I gave all of the children a tour of the grounds their first night here. I believe many of the Gryffindor students are in the habit of getting lost.\" The Slytherins chuckled. \\nJames grinned at Malfoy. \"Yes sir. I\\'ll show her to the Headmaster\\'s office. I actually know the way.\" \\nMalfoy grinned evilly at Ron, who could by then easily imagine horns growing out of Malfoy\\'s head. This time, Ron added huge fangs, and stuck Malfoy in a tutu, a trick he had learned from Professor Lupin (and Neville). He was disappointed to see that Malfoy didn\\'t explode. \\nLily turned and walked out of the doorway with James walking beside her, grinning as if it were Christmas. \\n\"What\\'s gotten into you, James?\" Lily asked quietly. \\n\"What do you mean?\" \\n\"You\\'ve changed. You aren\\'t... good anymore. You remind me of Uncle Dudley, except when Uncle Dudley tiptoed carefully around matters concerning us.\" \\n\"That\\'s because he knew what we were- how powerful we are! We have real magic, Lily! Can you imagine what we can do with it?\" \\n\"I want to find our father and live with him,\" Lily said, not mentioning she knew who their father was. \\n\"Well, we can\\'t live with him. We can\\'t even find him.\" \\nLily stared at him in disbelief. He hadn\\'t even noticed! Had whatever had a hold of him made him blind, as well as purely evil? \\n\"What?\" \\n\"We\\'re famous, Lily. We defeated the greatest wizard of all time- so did our dad. We\\'re destined to be great. Can\\'t you feel it? We can do whatever we want to! We can even- Oh, here we are.\" He stopped in front of a stone gargoyle which looked incredibly ugly. \\n\"Password?\" the gargoyle asked. \\nLily, ignoring James\\'s abashed look which told her that he didn\\'t know the password, climbed up next to the goblin and whispered into his ear. \\nThe gargoyle grinned and leapt out of her way and bowed to her as she walked through the wall, which had slid silently in two. \\n\"You know the password?\" James asked, incredulous. \\nLily nodded. \"I\\'m teaching Brownie English while I teach Becky Areanatu. She can\\'t speak it, but she can understand it.\" \\n\"Do you know the Slytherin house\\'s password?\" James asked, nervous now. \\nLily simply smiled at him as the wall closed behind her. \\nShe sighed and stepped onto the spiral staircase, which seemed to go continuously upward like an escalator. As she rose continually higher, she silently thanked Brownie for reporting to her all the English the small spider had understood at breakfast that morning. The Slytherins password, she had been told, hadn\\'t changed in years. It was \"Pure blood.\" The Hufflepuffs had \"Whatchamacallit,\" and the Ravenclaws had chosen, \"Riple Whople.\" \\nLily roes higher, and she concentrated on looking at her shoes. Everything except the stairs seemed to be moving, and her stomach was beginning to churn. \\nAt the top of the stairs, she saw a door that was made of an oak so clean that the wood nearly shimmered. In the center of the door was a gleaming brass knocker shaped like a griffin. As Lily stuck out her hand to knock, the griffin moved to look her in the face, sliding across the door as it did so. \"You supposed to be here?\" it asked. \\n\"Yes,\" Lily said quietly. \"I think I\\'m in trouble.\" \\nThe griffin grinned. \"On the first day!\" He saw Lily\\'s troubled expression. \"Hey, don\\'t worry, kid. You ain\\'t the first one. The Weasley twins have been through here three times already. I mean, I know everything about those two, they\\'ve been here so many times. And besides, Potter\\'s got a good sense of humor, don\\'t let him trick you there.\" \\nThe griffin saw her scar. \"Another one! You Potters are nearly worse than the Weasleys. Good thing Hogwarts doesn\\'t see as many of you pass through here, though. If so, this place would\\'ve been burned to the ground long ago!\" Lily didn\\'t ask what he meant. \\n\"Here,\" the griffin told her. \"Knock, Potter will come, you\\'ll have your talking to- if you\\'re really in trouble- that is, and then you can be out of here in time for your next class. But you can\\'t come in without permission. Rules, you know.\" \\n\"Thank you,\" Lily said, as the griffin offered her its clasped brass wings to knock. She pulled on it and dropped it three times. \\n\"Come in,\" said a muffled voice from the other side of the door. \\nThe door swung open silently, and Lily stepped through. \\nIt wasn\\'t much of an office, although it was still much more elaborate than any others she had seen so far. Maps and astrology charts were fixed to the walls, squeezed in between bookshelves crammed with books. In front of her, there was a wooden desk made of shiny cherry oak which was itself covered with papers, quills, and other knickknacks which Lily couldn\\'t hope to name. On the other side of the desk was the man she\\'d seen next to Ron, Headmaster Potter. He rubbed his bangs over his forehead nervously when he saw her. \\nOn his shoulder, a magnificent bird with orange, red, and golden plumage turned to look at her. It looked to Lily as if the bird had been crying. The headmaster\\'s robe\\'s sleeve was soaked. \\n\"You\\'ll have to excuse Fawkes,\" he said. \"He\\'s been trying to heal my internal bleeding- which I don\\'t have- all morning.\" He shooed Fawkes with a hand until the bird jumped and flew into another room haughtily. \\n\"Fawkes is a phoenix,\" Headmaster Potter said, seeing Lily\\'s stunned look. \"Phoenixes\\' tears have healing powers-\" he raised his voice \"-BUT NOT FOR CERTAIN THINGS!\" From the other room, Lily heard an indignant squawk. \\nBehind her, Lily suddenly heard a grating sound as if metal was being scraped by wood. She turned to see what was causing it and saw the griffin, now turned around to face the office. It winked at her. \\n\"Fred,\" Headmaster Potter said. \"Turn around.\" \\n\"But-\" \\n\"No buts. This isn\\'t any of your business. Now go on.\" \\nThe griffin, now having a name to match its face, turned, muttering, \"I never get to see. The Potters! Something\\'s bound to explode, too, but will I see it? No. Not Fred. Never poor Fred. Never me, nope. Not me!\" He continued ranting while he turned around with a great amount of noise. His voice became muffled as he did so. \\nHeadmaster Potter sighed. \"You\\'ll have to excuse Fred,\" he told Lily. \"He\\'s named after Professor Weasley\\'s older brother, who caused quite a lot of mischief here in their day. His twin, George, has the staircase named after him. Sometimes George will stop suddenly so everyone will tumble down.\" \\nLily grinned nervously, trying to ignore the fact that she was sitting right across from her father, whom she hadn\\'t seen in ten years. \"Headmaster Potter, I\\'m here about-\" \\nHe chuckled. \"About Professor Malfoy. Superb trick, if I say so myself.\" \\n\"I\\'m sorry-\" Lily started, completely lost. She didn\\'t think it was funny at all. It had been totally wrong, and she was sure to pay for it. And then here was the headmaster, congratulating her on a job well done. \\n\"Call me Harry. I won\\'t punish you, if that\\'s what you\\'re thinking. You said so yourself, you couldn\\'t make the spiders do anything they didn\\'t want to do, and you also said they wanted to attack Malfoy, so I can\\'t hold you at fault. The fault is the spiders\\', and I can\\'t very well punish every spider inside these walls, can I?\" \\nLily shook her head. He had a point, but still... \\n\"So how is your first day at Hogwarts going?\" \\nLily hesitated. \"Well, Transfiguration was all right, but I got kind of worked up when I found out Brownie was bringing everyone to visit me in Ron\\'s class. I guess it was over nothing- Ron might actually be getting over his fear of spiders. When I first met him, he freaked when he saw Brownie and found out I could talk to her. I thought he was going to have a heart attack.\" \\nHarry chuckled. \"Yes, Hermione told me about Diagon Alley. So you can talk to spiders, hmm?\" \\nLily nodded. \"If I really wanted to, I could probably control them, but I really don\\'t want to do that.\" \\nHarry nodded. \"I understand. They\\'re friends- just different. You still don\\'t want to take advantage of them. \\nShe nodded. \"Exactly.\" \\nHarry looked at his watch, \"My. Well, you\\'d better hurry. Ron\\'s class is just ending. You have lunch and then- lucky you- Herbology. I\\'m jealous.\" If Lily was any good at all from getting feelings out of voices, she knew she wasn\\'t going to enjoy Herbology. Harry had finished the sentence in a dry tone. \\n\"Thank you, sir.\" \\n\"Harry. And thank you, Lily, for giving me one of the best laughs I\\'ve had in a long time.\" He chuckled again. \"You should have seen Malfoy come hopping in here. Your friends did a lovely job tying him up.\" \\nLily grinned uncertainly. \"Well, thank you, Harry, and, um, I\\'m glad you enjoyed it.\" \\nAs she left, she wondered at how odd the people at Hogwarts were. Headmasters who were actually pleased to have tricks played on teachers. Still, she felt even worse for Professor Malfoy. \\nAfter she had gone, Harry went over to one of the many bookshelves and pulled out a certain book that was covered in dust. Harry looked at it briefly, wondering how long it had been since it had last been opened. He set it on his desk carefully, sending up a fine cloud of dust. He coughed as his eyes watered and opened the book, sending up another thick cloud of dust which made his eyes water again. \\nShe knew who he was. He could tell. Perhaps not as well as Dumbledore could have told, but he could tell all the same. He had faith in her, plenty of faith. Hermione had told him of her success in Transfiguration. And he had been assured by both Ron and Hermione that Lily was different from James. Smart, quiet, unassuming, and definitely skilled. Harry knew to trust them, but actually meeting her had made up his mind that his two friends were completely right. Not only that, but he could feel it when she walked into the room. She was powerful. Perhaps more so even than himself. \\nHe wasn\\'t sure if he was doing it because he thought she would be perfectly capable of it, or if it was because he wanted to give her a gift- since he hadn\\'t given her anything in ten years, or if he wanted to give her a reward. \\nNevertheless, he found the spell and read through it. Then, he said it aloud. \\nHe could feel it now, the room had a special spell on it. Anything said could be understood by spiders. If Lily wanted to, she could find out everything that was said in his study. \\n \\n* * * \\n \\n\"You should have seen him, though!\" Ron yelled in Harry\\'s study. He stooped low to the ground with his harms opened wide. \"He was like this- he had a hold of Chris and Kevin, you see- and then he saw all of those spiders coming towards him, looking terrible, and then he looked like this.\" Ron dropped his mouth and made it and his eyes as wide and open as they would go. \"And then the spiders completely covered him and he started trying to squash them-\" He started to jump around and stomp as much as he could. \"-but he didn\\'t get a single one- even though there was the huge swarm of them. And then the spiders started to cover him in webbing, and he tore out of the room. You should have seen him! By the time he got in here, he\\'d fallen nearly ten times because he couldn\\'t move his legs! He had to move like this.\" Ron placed his feet together, his arms to his sides, and starting hopping around like a spring. \"And then George knocked him off the stairs tons of times, and Fred wouldn\\'t let him in until the spiders started to bite him. And, I must admit, I helped a bit. Every chance I got, I stuck my wand into the webbing near his feet so he\\'d fall again!\" He let out a roar of laughter. \\n\"Ron!\" Hermione said strictly, but it lost its effect as she fell out of her chair, grabbing her sides and laughing. Her face had turned red. \\nHarry laughed. \"You should have seen him when he came in here, Hermione. His face was completely beet red, and he was stuttering, and he couldn\\'t even stand still. I am glad Fawkes kept the spiders out of the office, though.\" \\nHermione wiped her eyes. \"So, Ron, are you over your fear of spiders?\" \\n\"As long as they never do to me what they did to Malfoy.\" \\nHermione chuckled. \"You know what Lily told me?\" \\n\"What?\" Harry and Ron both asked eagerly. \\n\"Brownie wants to make it a tradition. Says that once a week will do nicely- maybe more often.\" Harry and Ron looked at each other, grinning. \"And Brownie says that next time, they\\'ll tie Malfoy to his bed!\" \\nThey all started laughing this time. Hedwig came through the window, looked at Fawkes, bewildered by the humans\\' behavior and promptly flew out again. \\n* * * \\n\"I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t get in twouble,\" Soup muttered for the umpteenth time. \\n\"I know,\" Lily said dreamily. The crowd of Gryffindors celebrating what had happened earlier to Professor Malfoy had finally left. Soup, Doug, Becky, and Lily, the only ones left in the common room, had just noticed that it was so late, it was early. \"I can\\'t believe I got to meet my father. After all these years.\" \\n\"Cool, isn\\'t he?\" Becky asked with a grin. \\nLily nodded. \"I\\'ve decided.\" \\nBecky and Soup leaned in, giving her their full attention. Doug, who had been slightly troubled since Transfiguration, finally turned away from the window to look at her. \\n\"I want to find out why no one told me Harry was my father.\" \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer- most of these characters in the following story- you know who they are- are not mine.

Over N out! \\n Chapter Ten \\nThe Greenskin Potion \\nLily looked to the teachers\\' table, and caught Malfoy\\'s eye. She quickly looked away as her scar began to burn. Her scar had done that every time she\\'d seen Malfoy since Monday. The problem was, he wasn\\'t the only one who was beginning to make it burn. Every time James looked at her, it felt as if it were on the point of exploding. \\nHowever, every time Harry looked at her, the scar seemed to warm, but it was a pleasant feeling. Not one that would nearly scare her half to death. \\nEveryone was in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. Soup was sitting to her left, with Doug on his left, and Becky sitting on her right. \\n\"Mail should be arriving any minute,\" Becky whispered to her. \\n\"Gee, can\\'t wait,\" Doug muttered sourly. Every morning, he got an owl from his mother, and he would always hastily scribble down on the parchment she sent him before he sent it back. After this, he was always in a bad mood, and the others had learned to stay away from him for a while. \\nSeveral changes had been made since Monday. Now, no matter what time it was, there were always spiders around the Gryffindor table, and spiders could always be found in the Gryffindor common room, always getting more and more at home. The Gryffindors, however, were actually enjoying this. They often left out food to attract flies for them. Lily would have expected this to frighten many people, but instead, everyone seemed to be amazed at the thought of somewhat tame spiders, and they enjoyed the reputation it brought. \\nAnother change was that Ron, from that point on, entered the Great Hall with his arms pressed to his sides and hopped up to the teachers table, always asking Malfoy if he\\'d seen any spiders around lately. Ron also seemed to have gotten over his fear of spiders- but he still wouldn\\'t voluntarily get within ten feet of one. \\n\"It\\'s Fwiday,\" Soup muttered, also staring at Malfoy. \\n\"I can\\'t wait,\" Lily mumbled, unpleased. \\n\"You know,\" said Chris from next to Becky, \"I\\'d watch out for Malfoy. He absolutely hates Gryffindors, and with that fabulous display Monday, he\\'ll be out to get you.\" \\n\"In more ways than one,\" Kevin added. \\n\"Meaning?\" Becky pushed. \\n\"If you don\\'t watch out, he\\'ll probably try to get your heads on silver platters.\" \\n\"He\\'s the Potions master, so he\\'ll probably try to make a curse so you\\'ll boil down to-\" Kevin looked at his brother. \"Well, he\\'s been known to do some pretty drastic things.\" \\n\"Turn people orange. \\n\"Melt a bunch of holes in them. \\n\"Shrink certain things for laughs. One time, he shrank Albert\\'s arms and refused to grow them back again.\" \\n\"Or he makes things bigger.\" \\n\"Noses.\" \\n\"Lips.\" \\n\"Eyes.\" \\n\"Sometimes, he\\'ll sneak potions into your food and drink that make you gag so you can\\'t breathe.\" \\n\"And your face starts to change shape.\" \\n\"You start having spasms right on the floor.\" \\n\"And you can\\'t speak because the potion burns your lips together.\" \\n\"So you look like a blistering idiot.\" \\n\"And he refuses to do a thing.\" \\nThe twins paused thoughtfully, looking from each other to the four fearful faces staring at them. \\nKevin spoke again. \"Or he could just give you detention.\" \\nThe quartet sighed, realizing they\\'d been taken for fools. One by one, they all looked to Becky, who had more experience and would surely put the Weasley twins in their place. \\nBecky stared back at them. \"What?\" she asked when they hadn\\'t blinked in nearly a minute. \\nSoup pointed at the Weasley twins, who were now grinning and toasting each other and then glared back at Becky. \\nBecky sighed. \"I\\'m not saying they\\'re right or wrong, I think I know that they were putting us on, but the point is, I wouldn\\'t put it past Malfoy to do any of those things.\" \\nLily gasped. Soup and Doug looked at each other and then stared at their food. They all sat in silence for a while. \\n\"But we are going to the library this afternoon, aren\\'t we?\" Lily asked sharply. They hadn\\'t had a chance to do research yet. Tuesday, they had spent the afternoon and night sleeping off the night before, and Wednesday, they\\'d had to get up at midnight for Astrology class with Professor Nadim in the Astrology tower. Thursday, they\\'d slept off the effects of that. But they\\'d have this afternoon off. \\n\"Sure, sure,\" Doug muttered, secretly hoping something would come up and they wouldn\\'t be able to make it. He had never been a fan of research, and he wasn\\'t going to start now. \\n\"MAIL!\" someone shouted. \\nLily gave a slight start. She\\'d nearly freaked the first day the hundreds of owls had spilled into the room from every direction, and she still gave a slight jump every time she saw it. \\nOrion hadn\\'t brought her anything yet, but Wendelyn had always amused her, flying in and then flying in circles above them as Doug hastily wrote to his mother. \\nHowever, this time, Lily spotted Orion in the crowd of owls and stared as he flew towards her. He dropped a scroll on her plate, which she luckily hadn\\'t filled yet. Hastily, Lily picked it up and undid the string. She unrolled it and showed it to Becky and Soup, but Doug was muttering to himself as he wrote to his mother. \\nLily read aloud, \"Would you like to eat lunch with us all at Hagrid\\'s cottage?\" \\nShe looked up and waved at Ron and Hermione, who were grinning broadly at her. \\n\"Well? Shall we?\" she asked Becky and Soup. They nodded eagerly. Lily swallowed and reached over to poke Doug gently. He looked up, a distant look in his eyes. \\n\"What?\" \\n\"Do you want to go to lunch with Ron, Hermione, and anyone else who might be there?\" \\nLunch? That would mean they wouldn\\'t have to go to the library if he made it last for a while. \"Sure.\" \\n\"All right.\" Lily took out a pen, which she carried around with her out of habit. She wrote \"Can\\'t wait- We\\'re all coming. Lily.\" She rolled up the scroll again and handed it to Orion, who hesitated. \\n\"Oh, I think I understand. Here, take some bread. How about some bacon?\" Orion hooted happily and dug in. \\nA few minutes later, Orion finished Lily\\'s meal, grabbed the scroll in his talons, and took it to the teachers\\' table, dropping it on Ron\\'s lap. \\n\"At least we\\'ll have something to look forward to in Potions,\" Lily said hopefully. \\n* * * \\nPotions, however, was worse than they could have thought. They had forgotten that they had double Potions with the Slytherins until Doug reminded them. He seemed to be in a better mood than usual. Lily supposed he had the lunch to look forward to. \\nThey left the Great Hall and headed back to the Gryffindor house to get their books before setting off to the dungeons. \\nWhen they entered, the first thing Lily noticed was that it seemed as if all the spiders in Hogwarts were crammed into the common room. The many Gryffindors in the room were staring at all of them in awe. They\\'d never seen so many spiders in here before. \\nBrownie! Lily called out immediately. A sudden hush fell over the spiders as the humans in the room turned to stare at Lily, watching for any hints of what was going on. \\nComing, girl. I\\'m coming. \\nIn the name of Athena, Lily rushed, what is going on here? \\nHarry\\'s- Headmaster\\'s Potter\\'s study is going on, that\\'s what, Brownie told her crossly, not appreciating the way Lily had used Athena\\'s name. All the spiders can understand what is said there. \\nEveryone waited in silence. Lily looked around. Can you understand what is said in here? \\nNo. Nowhere but that study. \\nAnd you can understand everything said there? \\nHow many times must I tell you? Yes! \\nLily told the kids in the common room and explained- only mentioning that the spiders could understand everything said in Headmaster Potter\\'s office. The Weasley twins, who had just walked in, let out an excited whoop. \"See if they can tell us where they\\'re hiding the packet of cherry bombs they took from us yesterday,\" Kevin asked. \\nLily repeated this to Brownie. \\nIt\\'s in the cupboard of Hagrid\\'s cottage, Brownie told her crossly. \\nWhen Lily told them this, the twins looked crushed. \"Hagrid\\'s cottage,\" Chris muttered. \"We\\'ll never see them it again.\" He looked at Kevin and the two grinned evilly at each other before dashing off. \\nUntil it was taken, Brownie said evilly. \\nHow could that happen? Lily asked Brownie. How can all of the spiders understand all the English spoken in Harry\\'s study but nowhere else? \\nThe Wise Ones are looking through the Webs now, Brownie told her. \\nHowever, this explanation merely managed to confuse Lily more. What? she asked. \\nBrownie made her most human-like sigh. A long time ago, the Ancient Ones recorded all the spider magic in Webs that serve much like humans\\' books. The first person like you taught us how to record things, and ever since, special spiders we call the Wise Ones have looked after the Webs, keeping them in tact and such. \\nLily nodded to herself. She motioned to the others, and the quartet went to the far side of the room where Lily explained to them what had happened. \\nBecky looked up suspicious. \"Why would they do that?\" \\nLily shook her head. \"I don\\'t think they could understand what was said before, which means that it happened sometime this week.\" \\n\"This week. The first week of school,\" Doug muttered slowly, mostly to himself. \\n\"The first week when his kids come to Hogwarts,\" Becky added. \\n\"Isn\\'t it obvious?\" Soup asked. They looked at him in surprise. \"Lily knows what they say, and then they can make out all that\\'s said in the study. The guys wanted Lily to know what was said, via the spidas.\" \\nLily nodded. \"But what would be so interesting about what\\'s said in his study?\" \\nBecky shrugged. \"It would be their first gift to you, besides the owl, in years. Maybe they\\'re trying to catch up.\" \\nLily nodded and smiled. \"Maybe if something interesting happens, it\\'ll be a great gift.\" \\n\"Just hope they don\\'t do their taxes in there,\" Doug pointed out. \"My mom says that\\'s the most boring event of every year.\" \\nSoup checked his watch. \"We\\'d betta go. Potions is in a few minutes.\" \\n\"How many minutes?\" Becky asked, suddenly sounding tired. \\n\"Five.\" \\n\"FIVE!\" \\nWith that, they tore out of the room, dodging spiders and their webs. \\n* * * \\nThey arrived just in the nick of time. Most of the other students were already there, standing next to their already fully set-up cauldrons. Everyone turned as they ran in, out of breath and practically gasping for air. Not only had they had only five minutes, but Becky had gotten them lost a number of times, and they thought they had made pretty good time. \\n\"Ms Potter and company,\" Professor Malfoy sneered. \"How nice of you to join us. Wanted to make an entrance, did you?\" \\n\"No sir.\" Lily said cautiously, not wanting a previously made enlarging potion to suddenly appear and hit her out of nowhere. \"We got lost on the way here, sir.\" \\n\"Did you? Then I suggest you don\\'t get lost in the future. Now find a place to set up your cauldrons. Two to each.\" \\nAs they walked to the back of the room to set up their cauldrons, several of the Slytherins turned to sneer at them, muttering about how typical it was of Gryffindors to get lost on the way to class. \\n\"No spiders are coming, are they, Ms Potter?\" \\n\"No sir.\" \\n\"Then let\\'s begin. Everyone, take the crushed spider legs...\" \\nLily froze and looked to Becky, who was sharing Lily\\'s cauldron with her. Becky nodded, almost imperceptibly, and scooped the spider legs into her own hand. Malfoy saw this out of the corner of his eye and became thoughtful. After a while, Lily realized that he was trying to make Becky wait to get rid of the spider legs in her hand. \\n\"Now, if we wanted to make a potion that would turn someone\\'s skin green, what would we add to it?\" He looked around the room to call on someone. James had his hand in the air, confident in his answer and seemingly acting nonchalant. He was sitting with another Slytherin directly in front of Becky and Lily. Lily, although she knew the answer, was too busy staring, frozen, at the crushed spider legs in Becky\\'s hand to raise her own hand. Had Professor Malfoy meant to do this? What was she thinking? Of course he\\'d meant to. It was some sort of revenge for what the spiders had done to him Monday. Okay, she might have had a small part in it, but it had mostly been the spiders. \\n\"Ms Potter?\" \\n\"Eye of newt and a chokecherry, sir.\" \\nShe looked away from the spider legs just in time to see, momentarily, a look of surprise on Malfoy\\'s face. He quickly covered it up. \"All right. Next question. Where could you find a splintop?\" \\n\"On the island of Sri Lanka, sir.\" \\n\"Okay, answer this. If I wanted to make a boiling potion, where would I look to find a fluent?\" \\n\"You wouldn\\'t waste your time, sir. The fluent went extinct long ago, and even back then, the boiling potion was sometimes faulty.\" \\n\"It didn\\'t say that in the book.\" \\n\"Yes it did. The fourth paragraph on the page.\" \\n\"Which page?\" Malfoy snapped, snatching up Becky\\'s book. Becky glared at him, and then looked at the crushed spider legs in her hand thoughtfully, as if thinking how wonderful it would be to simply throw all of the crushed spider legs in his hair- or, even better, his eyes or mouth. She grinned evilly and looked up by mistake, seeing Lily\\'s glare, which was directed at her. Becky tried her best to calm down. \\n\"Page 138, sir.\" Lily wasn\\'t sure how she remembered, but she was certain it was on that page. \\nMalfoy flipped to the page, nearly tearing the sheets out. He skimmed the page Lily had said. His eyes seemed to pop out, and he went back to the beginning to read over the page again. This time, he kept his eyes an inch away from the page, staring at each letter and word as if it were a traitor, and at any moment he might shoot it down. \\nHe threw the book back on the desk. \"Yes, well.\" He cleared his throat and went back to the front of the room. \\nMany of the Gryffindors turned to Lily and gave her the thumbs-up sign, smiling at her. Nearly all the Slytherins turned to sneer at her. James hissed \"Show off,\" and \"Know-it-all\" at her. Lily tried her best to ignore him. \\n\"Mr Potter, at what point would I put the eye of newt and the chokeberry into the cauldron?\" \\nJames immediately turned around and looked angelic. \"You would put the spider legs in when the water starts boiling, along with the eye of newt. You would then stir those together until it makes a kind of brownish color, and then you would add the chokecherry.\" \\nMalfoy grinned at him. \"Very good. Very good, indeed. Five points to Slytherin.\" \\nThe Gryffindors gaped at each other. It was obvious that Malfoy had already run the Slytherins through this, step by step. James would have gotten it right! It even sounded like James had quoted it word for word from a book. No, he had probably quoted Malfoy. Kiss up to the teacher. But Lily had gotten all of the tough questions, and she hadn\\'t gotten a single point! Not even half of one! James turned and grinned maliciously at Lily, who smiled back. She hadn\\'t counted on receiving any points. And she knew that Malfoy wouldn\\'t be giving her any. \\n\"Now, everyone fill your cauldrons, set on the heaters, and wait for them to boil. We\\'ll see if you get this right.\" \\nLily filled their cauldron with water- since Becky could only use one hand unless she wanted to lose some of the spider legs- and flicked the switch to turn the heater on, briefly thinking of how lucky they were. She\\'d read in A History of Magic that in the old days, they\\'d had to burn wood and set the cauldron above it and then wait for it to boil. Now, all they had to do was flick a switch, and a second later, the cauldron would boil. \\nAs it began to do so, Becky brushed the crushed spider legs into the water, and Lily dropped in the eye of newt. They began to stir. Lily watched the color until it turned a brown color and dropped in the chokecherry. \\nThe chokecherry seemed to explode as it sank under the water, and sent out a thick yellow cloud into the water, when the cloud had seemingly stopped moving, the water slowly but surely began to turn green. \\nIn front of her, Lily heard James whisper to his partner how it was such a shame he and his siter and been placed in different houses. After all, Professor Malfoy had said twins were stronger than other wizards and witches- especially together. Lily dismissed it, knowing that James was probably trying to play a trick on her. \\nMalfoy was walking through the cauldrons, making comments on what had been done wrong to the Gryffindors, but telling all the Slytherins what a fine job they had done. He smiled at James, saying that the potion he and his partner, Tomas, had brewed was perfect. He reached Becky and Lily\\'s cauldron and peered into it. Lily waited, certain that he would say \"Too green,\" or \"Not green enough,\" or some other picky tidbit. Instead, he straightened himself again, glared at her- making her scar burn- and walked away. \\nAs he was observing Doug and Soup\\'s potion, Lily heard James in front of her tell his partner, \"Hey, check this out.\" James leaned closer to the cauldron. \"Double, bubble-\" Instantly, the cauldron started to boil, sending up small splashes and a few green bubbles that popped. The droplets fell back into the cauldron. James looked up and grinned at Tommy, who was getting the Slytherins\\' attention, and, by doing so, was getting everyone\\'s attention except Malfoy\\'s. \"-Toil and trouble. Fly from the cauldron, and land on...\" He looked around for a victim, no doubt a Gryffindor, but the Gryffindors were all leaning in, trying to see what was going on. \"...ABBY!\" \\nThe potion flew out of the cauldron, heading towards Abby, the nearest Gryffindor. Abby held her hands out as if to stop it, but it did no good. She gave a quick shriek as the potion landed on her, and everyone in the room began to hear it sizzle. Abby\\'s skin started turning green. \\n\"What is going on here?\" Malfoy shouted, wheeling around as if he had just noticed that something was going wrong. \\n\"It\\'s Abby, sir,\" James said. \"I think she botched up her potion somehow. It exploded right in front of her.\" \\n\"Ten points from Gryffindor,\" Malfoy said, ignoring the fact that Abby\\'s potion was still in the cauldron, but James\\'s cauldron was perfectly empty. \"Foolish girl. I would have thought anyone would have had more sense.\" Malfoy continued to lecture her. \\nLily dropped in another chokecherry into the potion and watched as it turned a shade of blue. Collecting a spoonful, she walked over to where Abby was kneeling. Without saying anything so as not to interrupt Malfoy\\'s lecture, she took Abby\\'s hands and spread the blue mixture, which had become a bit gooey, on them. When she rubbed the potion off a few seconds later, Abby\\'s skin was normal again. \\n\"Ms. Potter, what are you doing?\" Malfoy snapped at her, just then realizing that she was there. \\n\"I was trying to help Abby, sir.\" \\n\"And how did you think you were going to do that?\" \\n\"If you add one more chokecherry, you get a counter-potion\" \\n\"Go to your seat. Ten points off Gryffindor for a student moving out of her place when not told to.\" \\n\"But-\" Becky interrupted. \\n\"Silence!\" roared Malfoy. \"If anyone speaks without first being spoken to, they will lose points for their house! Do you understand, Longbottom?\" \\nAll of the Slytherins snickered, and even many of the Gryffindors grinned (although they tried hard to hide it). Becky was the only one who didn\\'t seem to think her last name was funny- besides Lily, Doug, and Soup- the boys, though, were also trying desperately to cover up their grins. \\n\"Yes, sir.\" \\nClass went on in much the same way. Although Lily had worked out a cure for Abby, Malfoy still sent Abby to the infirmary, saying that was she had done was dangerous and if it were up to him, he\\'d never have her in his classroom again, and that she should be thankful the potion hadn\\'t been life-threatening. \\nTowards the end of the class, many of the Gryffindors were checking their watches, trying not to let their actions be seen by Malfoy. What the older kids had told them was true- Malfoy hated Gryffindors and loved Slytherins. \\n* * * \\n\"It was awful!\" Becky complained loudly. Neville frowned and seemed about to stroke her hair, stopping when she realized that she was probably too old for that. Meanwhile, Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid tried not to laugh out loud. \\n\"It wasn\\'t that bad,\" Lily said honestly. \\nBecky stared at her in awe and amazement and, maybe, even a little disgust. \"Aren\\'t you upset with him at all?\" she asked, incredulous, as she stirred the batter for the cake Hermione was making for dessert. \"He took ten points off of you! In all the other classes, you made points. You didn\\'t have them taken away. And then in his class, you can\\'t get points. Instead, he just takes them away.\" \\n\"Gryffindor is still in the lead for the House Cup,\" Lily pointed out. \"As long as I don\\'t do anything to give him a reason to take any points away, he won\\'t.\" \\nRon ran his hands through his hair. \"Goodness. Another Hermione in the making.\" \\nHagrid and Harry both choked on their tea and had to cough for a few minutes, although they laughed the entire time, which didn\\'t help. Hermione simply stood in the kitchen, looking sternly at Ron with her hands on her hips, her wand clutched tightly in her hand as Neville tried to figure out what was so funny. To him, Hermione was fine. What would be wrong with another one? \\nHoping to change the subject, Lily asked, \"Why aren\\'t we allowed to go into the Forbidden Forest?\" \\nHarry cleared his throat. \"Many things. The first that Hagrid is one of the few people here who can go into the woods and then find his way out. Most people get lost.\" \\nRon grinned. \"My nephews being among them.\" \\nNow Hagrid grinned. \"I\\'m jus\\' glad they haven\\' learned their way \\'round there. Then I\\'d really \\'ave my work cut out.\" He laughed while the others chuckled. Lily looked at Becky, conveying the message that this seemed to be a private joke of Hagrid\\'s, and that anyone who laughed merely did so to be polite. \\nHarry continued. \"There are tons of dangerous creatures.\" \\n\"Like Aragog?\" she cut in. \\nHe nodded, though whether it was to her or to himself, she wasn\\'t sure. \"Yes. Aragog and his entire family. Then all the other spiders. Centaurs are there, too. Unicorns. Speaking of which, Hagrid? Has there been any trouble lately?\" \\n\"\\'Pends what kin\\' yeh mean.\" \\n\"Any animals at all.\" \\n\"The snakes \\'ave all left. Couldn\\' handle James, I guess.\" He laughed while Harry and Lily grinned feebly and Neville breathed a sigh of relief. \\nThis time, it was Hermione\\'s turn to change the subject. \"I think you\\'ll like it here at Hogwarts, though, guys. We\\'ll have a Halloween feast. Everyone goes in costume.\" \\nRon frowned. \"Speaking of which, I overheard Chris and Kevin talking about the feast. And they only talk about things that early when they\\'re planning something.\" \\n\"I know nothing,\" Soup muttered. \\nRon looked at him with a suspicious grin while Hermione stared sternly at Soup, and Harry looked at him, amused, but they didn\\'t push anything. \\nLily looked at them curiously. Ron saw the look and grinned widely at her. \\n\"My nephews have a habit of getting into trouble. We let them get into it. I guess you could say we need as many laughs as we can get.\" \\nThe younger children smiled politely although Becky was the only one to actually laugh. Lily, Doug, and Soup looked at exchanged confused looks. None of them had ever had teachers like these. \\nEveryone worked through dinner. Talking to the adults is actually easy, Lily thought quite often to herself. They aren\\'t much more than kids themselves. \\nAfter dinner, Hermione looked at her watch and jumped. \"Goodness! If you four don\\'t move fast, you\\'re going to be the late! The Fat Lady always goes to visit other portraits at nine!\" \\n\"The dishes-\" Lily began. \\nHagrid grinned. \"Don\\'t worry about the dishes. You\\'d better get goin\\' \\'fore she leaves, o\\' you\\'ll be locked out.\" \\nThe four children obediently ran out of the cottage and across the grounds. \\nDoug fell in step with Lily, who was having trouble holding up her robes and keeping a grip on her wand at the same time. \\n\"Can you believe them?\" Doug asked her. \"I\\'ve never met teachers like those.\" He shook his head. \\n\"I know,\" Lily agreed. \"I hate to say it, but I almost miss my old teacher. They were... predictable.\" \\nDoug nodded in agreement. \"I can\\'t wait till Halloween already,\" he told her. \"At least things are supposed to be weird then.\" \\n* * * \\nHermione started putting the dishes in the sink to soak. Although she was one of the most talented witches of the time and a teacher at Hogwarts, she still tended to do some things the muggle way- something Ron never failed to point out. \\nHarry cleared his throat loudly. \"I\\'ve been thinking,\" he announced. He was going to tell them now. They had to know- or did they? Well, he\\'d gotten half of it out of the way; he\\'d just have to finish. He\\'d decided they should know, so he\\'d tell them. Simple. \\nHermione flicked her wand and the dishes started washing themselves. She turned to face Harry, already knowing by the awful feeling in her stomach what he was going to say. Ron and she exchanged nervous glances. \\nHagrid sat down patiently. He\\'d learned after time to be patient with Harry. If the younger man wanted Hagrid to know something, Harry would tell him. \\nNeville, however, was leaning forward in his seat, threatening to tip the chair over. He\\'d always wanted James and Lily to be able to stay at Hogwarts. Becky, in his opinion, needed a friend, and he had never understood why Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid moped about the problem when the answer was so simple. \\n\"Yes?\" Hermione prodded. \\nHarry cleared his throat again. \"I\\'ve been thinking that maybe James and Lily should stay with me. Just over the summer.\" \\nNeville and his chair fell onto the floor with a crash. Hagrid helped him up while Ron set the chair back. \\n\"Harry,\" Hermione said evenly, in an all-too-patient voice. \"We discussed this. They\\'re better off at the Dursleys. It\\'s safer.\" \\n\"I know, but-\" \\n\"You said so yourself, Voldemort will never think to look for them there. Why take a chance now?\" \\n\"Because-\" \\n\"No, Harry. It\\'s too dangerous.\" \\n\"Can\\'t I at least tell them that I\\'m their-\" \\n\"Why?\" Ron asked, stepping into the \"conversation\" for the first time. \"Why now? You\\'d only get their hopes up. They\\'d have a lot of questions. And I don\\'t think they\\'re ready to face Voldemort yet.\" \\n\"Oh all-\" \\n\"You might have them jumping at shadows,\" Ron went on. \\n\"Ron I-\" \\n\"They\\'d want to leave with you,\" Hermione added, \"and then you\\'d have to explain why not.\" \\n\"I said I-\" \\n\"The point is, Harry,\" Ron finished, \"is that we don\\'t think you should tell them.\" \\n\"I GET THE POINT!\" Harry shouted. Neville covered his ears with his hands. \\nHarry stormed out of the room, silently seething. He\\'d gotten the point. He\\'d tried to tell them so, and then they had just simply interrupted him as if what he said didn\\'t matter. He didn\\'t have to be reminded so often. A simple \"no\" would have done just fine! \\nHe stopped in the middle of the trail, hidden from the cottage by trees and stood looking at Hogwarts, trying to get his breath back. He just couldn\\'t help thinking that maybe his father would have been headmaster or teacher at Hogwarts after being forced to give Harry up to the Dursleys. His mother would be there too. But how would he have felt, never knowing they were his parents? Never knowing what had happened to him except for what other people told him, like it had been when he\\'d been growing up? What if he were in Lily\\'s or James\\'s shoes? Why couldn\\'t any of the others understand that? \\nWith a frustrated sigh, Harry continued up the path to Hogwarts. \\nBack in the cottage, Hermione sighed. \"What\\'s his problem?\" she asked no one in particular. \\nRon shrugged. \"You know Harry,\" he muttered. \"Spoilsport.\" \\nHermione knitted her brows. \"How is Harry a spoilsport? You two are almost as bad as both sets of twins.\" \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Ron said, using his exasperated voice. \"He just is.\" \\nUnder her breath, Hermione muttered, \"Whatever.\" \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer- a bunch of the characters in the following story belong to none other than the great N wonderful J.K.

He looked to make sure he had everyone\\'s attention, and was pleased- more or less- to see that even the Bloody Baron was looking at him. \"Today,\" Harry announced, \"is the day I\\'m sure many of you first years have been looking forward to.\" He saw Lily, who was mainly the only first year he was looking at, look to the other Gryffindors at her table questioningly. \"Professor Wood will be holding flying lessons this afternoon. Please see the schedules in your house common rules for further information.\" \\nHe sat down again and helped himself silently to some rolls and two pancakes. Ron looked at him and then looked away quickly while Hermione looked at Harry with a concerned look on her face. He hadn\\'t spoken to any of them, Hagrid and Neville included, since last Friday. If Harry saw her look, he chose to ignore it as he smeared butter on his pancakes. \\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Great Hall, the quartet was chattering. \\n\"Bwooms!\" Soup exclaimed. \"Broomsbwoomsbwoomsbwooms!\" Not even a sharp glare from both Becky and Doug would get him to stop and shut up. \\n\"I just hope I don\\'t fall off,\" Mandy said from beside Doug. \\n\"You won\\'t,\" Becky told her. \"It\\'s easy once you get the hang of it.\" She made a face. \"Just in case, though. If you fall, make sure you\\'re close to the ground.\" \\n\"Well that makes me feel a lot better,\" Mandy said dryly. She went back to talking to Erica. \\nAll of the Gryffindor first years raced through breakfast and made it back to their house common room in record time. Becky was in first after taking a short cut no one else knew about. \\nThe first thing the other three heard was the sound of her cussing. The Fat Lady covered her mouth with a hand as the other first years raced through. \\n\"What is it?\" Lily asked, making her way across the room to where Becky was seething by the schedule. \\n\"We have flying lessons with the Slytherins,\" Becky said between grated teeth. \\nNow all of the first years tumbled over each other. \\n\"Oh, no,\" Lily moaned. She fell over an armrest into a chair. \"One class a week with the Slytherins is enough, but two?\" \\n\"It\\'ll be okay,\" Soup told her as he patted one of her shoes, which were sticking up in the air. \\n\"Right,\" Lily responded dryly. \"In case you haven\\'t noticed, we\\'re doing these lessons with the Slytherins. James is a Slytherin. I hardly know my brother anymore. I don\\'t know why I even admit he\\'s my brother.\" \\n\"You don\\'t mean that,\" Becky told her. Although she herself hated James with all her heart and soul, she knew that Lily definitely didn\\'t feel that way. \\nLily sighed irately and looked at her watch. \"We\\'d better get going,\" she told them. \"Hermione\\'s class is in a few minutes. \\n * * * \\nNo matter how hard she tried- or for how long, Lily couldn\\'t be upset when everyone around her was in their best spirits. By the time she was in Ron\\'s class, it was hard to concentrate on her work with everyone around her so excited, but Ron had thankfully expected this and chosen an easy topic to pay attention to: counter curses for if anyone placed a jinx or curse on your broom. \\nBy lunch, all the Gryffindors, even Mandy and Erica, felt ready for that afternoon. During break, Soup had gone to check out Flying High from the library. It contained a lot tips on what to do in different situations, stunts to show off with, and even had an ad for the latest broom, the Lightyear 5000. Mandy was trying to find some cure for people who were afraid of heights. Everyone poured over its contents in the Gryffindor common room, except for Soup, who in the end hadn\\'t had the chance, and Lily had been busy talking to Brownie and the other spiders, who were telling her about what they\\'d heard in Harry\\'s office. It turned out that Flying High had apparently forgotten to mention all the people who had been injured while flying on their brooms. The spiders even told her that there had been a few deaths. For some reason, they seemed quite pleased with this, and it took Lily a while to understand that the spiders were just excited over how they could understand everything said in the office and were soakin g in everything they learned like juicy house flies. \\nBrownie shook an arm at Lily. I\\'m telling you, girl, she told Lily sharply, you fall off that broom or get hurt in any way, you\\'ll have to deal with the consequences. I will not be pleased. \\nDon\\'t worry about me, Lily told her. \\nI know. Worry about the others who deserve it. Let me tell you something, girl. Just because you can speak to spiders doesn\\'t mean you have spider blood. Mind you don\\'t slip off the broom. \\nLily, slightly touched by Brownie\\'s affection, leaned closer to the crack. Thanks, she told Brownie. \\nThe spider, however, had decided she\\'d seemed too much like a finch- too caring. She started scrambling for the crack in the floor. In the name of Athena, girl. Get one of those breath mints the other girls have. Your breath smells like a cat\\'s. \\nLily grinned and nodded. \\nAs they walked to the fields behind Hogwarts, Lily, Soup, Doug, and Becky fell into step with each other at the back of the line. \\nThe Slytherins were already there, next to the better-looking broomsticks and laughing about something, which, Lily was sure, was them. A man stood in front of them all, looking totally exasperated and a little angry. \\nThe Gryffindors came and took places next to the brooms left, which were, safe to say, not the best. \\nThe man in front of them sighed. \"All right. We\\'re all here?\" Everyone nodded. \"Good. I\\'m Professor Wood. First of all, mount your brooms like this. Let me see everyone\\'s grip.\" \\nWood floated on his broom, urging it forward slowly as he examined everyone\\'s grip. \\n\"Now then,\" he said after he was done. \"What we\\'re going to do now is kick off the ground, but softly. You want to go straight up, and not that much. Ready?\" Without waiting for them to nod, he continued. \"Go.\" \\nEveryone jumped at different levels. Many were very low and tried to get higher by kicking their feet. James and Lily were above them, sitting comfortably. Lily looked at Becky, who was a foot above her, and grinned. This was so easy! The only person who was having any trouble was Mandy, who had jumped too hard. Immediately, as if on cue, the Slytherins started snickering and jeering. \\nWood soared up on his broomstick. No one below could hear what was going on since they were too far up by then, but they did see Mandy hesitantly climb onto the broomstick behind Professor Wood. They came back down to the ground. Even from that far off, Lily could see the whites of Mandy\\'s eyes. \\nThey landed, and Mandy got off the broom shakily. \\nShe stumbled over to Erica, who had gotten off of her broom, and hugged her. \"I hate heights,\" Lily heard Mandy whisper. \"I hate them.\" \\nErica tried to calm her down and rubbed her back. She looked at Wood, obviously asking for mercy for her friend. \\nWood shrugged. \"I need to go get that broom. It takes a while to get new ones.\" He looked up, trying to find the broom. He groaned. \"Oh, no. It\\'s headed for the Forbidden Forest. I\\'d better get it fast.\" He looked at everyone before leaving. \"Promise you\\'ll be good?\" he asked. They all nodded slowly. \"Good. Detention to anyone who breaks his or her word.\" \\nHe soared off after the broom, speeding as fast as he could. \\nAs soon as Wood was out of earshot, the Gryffindors gathered around Mandy, trying to comfort her. The Slytherins roared with laughter. \\n\"Hey, watch this,\" James told everyone. He took a pack of something out of a pocket in his robe. \"Cherry bombs,\" he whispered to the Slytherins nearby. They chuckled. James took a cherry bomb out of the pack and threw it in the direction of the Gryffindors. It hit someone\\'s broom and exploded with a loud bang that made all of the Gryffindors jump and a few, for instance, Mandy, scream. \\n\"JAMES!\" Lily shouted. \\nJames snickered. \"Uh oh. I\\'m in trouble now. Little sister\\'s mad at me.\" He got on his broom and flew upwards. He dropped a cherry bomb into the Gryffindors\\' group. Everyone backed away from where it was expected to land, and Doug grabbed Mandy in the nick of time to keep her from getting hit. \\n\"That\\'s it!\" Lily yelled. She grabbed her broom and jumped on it. She soared up after James, somehow knowing how to go up and down and from side to side. James apparently knew how, too. He turned around to throw a cherry bomb or two at her. She dodged them easily. \\nJames pulled to a sudden halt. Lily veered so as not to fly into him. She did a loop in the air. It\\'s like being water, she thought to herself with joy. \\nJames dived and grabbed a branch from a near by tree. He struggled as he balanced with his weight and the branch\\'s, but he finally managed to steady himself. He glared at Lily as he grinned wickedly. Lily sat on her broom, hovering in the air, waiting. He threw the pack of cherry bombs into the air. Lily watched. She realized what James was going to do and went straight up just as he hit the pack of bombs with the stick. Immediately, most of them exploded, but there were some that hadn\\'t exploded, Lily knew, because they started going off one by one, slowly. Lily wondered how the bag was managing to stay in one piece and decided that it had to be magic. \\nJames laughed and went back down to the Slytherins. \"Good luck, little sister.\" \\nLily looked at the bag again, shaking in fury. He hadn\\'t been aiming it at her after all. He\\'d been aiming for the Gryffindors. \\nShe soared down. Two more cherry bombs exploded before she was within reach of it. Ten feet till she reached the Gryffindors. Mandy was standing stock still, staring at her in horror. If Mandy didn\\'t move- \\nLily urged her broom forward. She stuck her hand out, ready to catch the bag. Five feet. Two feet. Lily felt a corner of the bag and grabbed it as she veered off course and away from Mandy. One of the cherry bombs exploded in her hand. She yelped in pain and rolled off her broom into the grass. Becky hurried over to help her. \\n\"Are you okay?\" Becky asked. \\nLily blinked away tears, determined not to cry in front of the Slytherins or her brother. \"I\\'m fine. It\\'s just that- my hand hurts.\" She looked at it and cringed. No fingers were missing, and she supposed that was a good thing. The problem, though, was that her hand was covered in blood. She swallowed, trying to keep calm. \\n\"Excuse me. Excuse me. Okay, that\\'s it. Get out of the way, or I\\'ll blast you!\" Lily looked up and grinned as she blearily saw Hermione running towards them. \\n\"How is it?\" Hermione asked as soon as she saw Lily. She pushed aside another Gryffindor and saw Lily\\'s hand. She cursed under her breath. \"We\\'ll have to take you to Madam Pomfrey, I\\'m afraid. She\\'s tons better at healing than I am.\" She looked to Becky. \"I think you should come too.\" Hermione raised her voice. \"James?\" she called. \\nSilently, James walked over, looking at his shoes and acting perfectly innocent. \"It wasn\\'t my fault, Professor Granger,\" he said mournfully. \\nBecky gave a little humph as the Gryffindors, all except Lily, glared at him. \\n\"Don\\'t bother, James,\" Hermione told him tartly. \"I saw the entire thing. I\\'ll take you to see Headmaster Potter, and I\\'m sure your house will suffer a severe point loss for your antics, and you\\'ll will most likely have detention.\" \\n\"Not so fast, Professor Granger,\" said a new voice. Everyone turned to see Professor Malfoy standing there with a wide grin on his face. \"I believe that while young James and Ms. Potter were flying in the air, they were both told to stay on the ground and behave. Which means that they would both receive punishment.\" \\n\"I don\\'t mean that, Professor Malfoy. I mean the way Mr. Potter here threw that pack of cherry bombs right at the Gryffindors. An obvious attempt to harm them.\" \\n\"One: He didn\\'t throw the cherry bombs. He hit them. With a stick. Two: It\\'s harder to aim that way, and I seriously doubt he meant to harm anyone.\" He came up behind James and placed his hands on the boy\\'s shoulders. \"Isn\\'t that so, James?\" \\n\"Yes, sir.\" \\nLily cleared her throat. Hermione glanced at her as Lily held up her hand. Right then, it was numb, but Lily could have sworn that her thumb was starting to come back to life. Hermione\\'s eyes changed, and a bit of feeling came back into them. \\n\"We\\'ll discuss this later,\" Hermione told Malfoy curtly. \"Right now, I have to get Lily to the infirmary before her hand is beyond help. Don\\'t worry,\" she told the girl as Lily\\'s face blanched. \"We\\'ll get there in time. Come on. We\\'ll leave now.\" Grabbing Lily\\'s other arm, she led her and Becky o the infirmary. Lily tried not to listen to the sudden outburst of laughter from the Slytherins behind her. \\n * * * \\n\"Honestly,\" Madam Pomfrey, a short, gray-haired witch, said tiredly. \"I don\\'t see why people ride brooms. It\\'s so dangerous.\" \\n\"It was the cherry bombs that did it,\" Lily reminded her, defending flying. \"Besides, flying\\'s fun.\" \\nMadam Pomfrey shook her head. \"You and your father...\" \\nHermione cleared her throat loudly. Madam Pomfrey jumped and became silent as she poured a cream over Lily\\'s hand. \\n\"The skin is the only thing harmed,\" she explained. \"Wait about five minutes and then rub your hands together. It\\'s odd that cherry bombs would do that. Usually, if they do any harm at all, they just burn the skin.\" She told Lily and Becky crossly, \"But that doesn\\'t mean I approve of them at all.\" \\nHermione nodded. \"I think I know who might have done this. The Weasley twins need cherry bombs of sufficient strength to blast off all of those toilet seats.\" Now she also began to talk to Lily and Becky. \"They think I don\\'t know that the Gryffindor password- Taes Teliot- is \\'Toilet Seat\\' spelled backwards,\" she explained to them. \\nLily thought. \"I think I remember something about that. Kevin and Chris were asking where the cherry bombs were- the ones that Hagrid took from them- and I asked Brownie and she said that they were in Hagrid\\'s cottage, but they\\'d been taken.\" \\n\"Why did you ask Brownie?\" \\n\"The spiders can understand everything that\\'s said in Harry\\'s- Headmaster Potter\\'s\" she hastily corrected herself as she remembered Madam Pomfrey, \"study.\" \\n\"Since when?\" Lily looked more closely at Hermione, whose eyebrows were knit together, causing creases all over her forehead. \\n\"I thought you knew.\" \\nHermione shook her head. Lily and Becky looked at each other. \\n\"Rub those hands together, dear,\" Madam Pomfrey said to Lily. Lily looked at her hands, one of which seemed to be tinged gray, and the other looked too yellow for her tastes. The good thing was that all of her skin was back. She rubbed her hands together obediently. \"Get every bit,\" Madam Pomfrey added. Lily examined her hands. The gray one was beginning to turn back to the fair skin she was used to, and the yellow color was slowly but surely coming off of her other hand. When she was done, her hand was bare of all cuts and signs of the cherry bomb explosion and back to its regular tint. \\n\"Your done,\" Madam Pomfrey exclaimed with a touch of pride. \"Now go on, scat. I\\'ve got other patients, you know.\" \\nLily and Becky didn\\'t argue. Instead, they thanked her and walked into the hallway to wait for Hermione. As soon as the door was shut behind them, they lunged for it again and stuck their ears to the door. \\n\"-didn\\'t know he was going to do that,\" Hermione was saying. \"He should have talked to us first.\" \\n\"Relax, Hermione. He hasn\\'t seen them in ten years. I\\'d spoil them too, if they were my kids.\" \\n\"Still, if something happens...\" \\n\"Nothing will happen. You\\'ll see. It\\'s been quiet for nearly fifteen years.\" Hermione cleared her throat in the silence, and Lily could easily imagine the unconvinced look she was giving Madam Pomfrey. \"Well, all right. Ten years, then. But it could have been fifteen, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named hadn\\'t tried to get revenge.\" \\n\"Poppy,\" Hermione said tiredly. \"Use Voldemort.\" Becky\\'s eyes popped on the other side of the door, and Lily had to hush her as Becky clapped her hand over her mouth. \"It doesn\\'t do to be afraid of a name.\" \\n\"Sure, sure,\" Madam Pomfrey said, unconvinced. \\nHermione sighed. \"I\\'ve got to go now. Take the two eavesdroppers outside to the Gryffindor house.\" \\nLily and Becky quickly backed away from the door, staring at each other in surprise. \"She couldn\\'t have known,\" Lily whispered. \\nHermione came out of the room, looking as if she hadn\\'t known they had been listening. Following suit, the two girls straightened their backs and tried their best to look innocent while Hermione tried hard to keep from laughing at their efforts. \\n\"Well,\" she said, changing the subject. \"I\\'m glad to tell you that I don\\'t think you\\'ll be punished, Lily. Malfoy wouldn\\'t do anything that would get a Slytherin in more trouble than a Gryffindor. And, we have an opening on the Quidditch team for seeker.\" \\n\"Seeker?!\" Becky exclaimed. She looked over at Lily. \"I told you you\\'d make a good Seeker!\" she told Lily excitedly. Lily grinned back, slightly uncertain. \\n\"If you don\\'t mind my asking, Hermione, what does a Seeker do?\" \\nHermione\\'s brows knitted together again. \"Catches the Snitch, of course.\" She looked at Lily and saw that this hadn\\'t helped matters. \"I\\'ll let Melissa explain it all to you. Melissa McKenzie is the Gryffindor Quidditch team\\'s captain,\" she explained further.\" \\n\"Oh.\" \\n\"I\\'ll tell her as soon as I see her. If my guess is correct, she\\'s on the Quidditch field right now, trying out her new broom that she got from her parents for the school year to celebrate. She was voted captain just last year, you see. This is her first year coaching. The broom is a Lightyear 2000. You\\'ll probably need a 5000, though. I\\'ll talk to Harry.\" Hermione\\'s features clouded slightly. \"You to go on to the house. I really have to talk to Harry.\" \\n\"It wasn\\'t such a bad thing, was it?\" Lily asked, hoping to stand up for Harry. She\\'d heard of stories about what happened when Hermione got mad. She didn\\'t want to hear one about Hermione\\'s anger being directed at her father. \\nHermione looked down her nose at her. Lily looked away and walked with Becky to the Gryffindor house. \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer- a lot of the following characters belong to J.K. Rowling. The rest, sadly, are mind- I mean, MINE. Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Twelve The Twick \\nAfter a while, Lily decided that she was the lucky one. The Sorting Hat had been right. She\\'d memorized her books- though she had no idea how. As soon as she got out of classes, she had to go and practice Quidditch with the Gryffindor team. Melissa McKenzie, Lily had to admit, was a pretty tough coach. First, she made Lily memorize all the rules and plays until Lily got her broomstick. \\nIt arrived by owl on a Saturday morning, which (Becky told her with a groan) meant that she would be practicing on it for the rest of the day. \\nBy the end of the day, she was ready and well prepared for their first game. \\nNo one knew that Lily was on the Gryffindor team except for Becky, Doug, Soup, and the Gryffindor team. They were saving her as a surprise for the Slytherins. (\"Think of it as a birthday present,\" Melissa had said. \"You\\'re going to jump out of the cake and steal the show. Not to mention the game.\") \\nMuch to the Slytherins disgust, Lily managed to balance Quidditch and still get good marks on all of her papers and quizes. Most surprised and disgusted of all was James, who didn\\'t bother to read any of their books- unless it was about something particularly gruesome. \\nMeanwhile, Halloween was getting closer and closer. This was apparently a big event at Hogwarts. The older kids were buzzing about Halloween, filling Lily and the others in. Besides the costume party, the teachers decorated the front hall until it was barely recognizable. The ghosts did a \"haunted house,\" which doubled as Nearly Headless Nick\\'s (the Gryffindor ghost) deathday. \\n\"Deathday?\" Lily had asked in shock. \"He celebrates a deathday?\" \\n\"Of course,\" Becky had answered her. \"Who wants to celebrate the day they were born when they\\'re dead? Besides, a deathday is kind of like a second birthday, into a different kind of life, you know?\" \\nLily had nodded, still shocked. \\nNo one bothered Chris and Kevin, who were acting more and more secretive. \\n * * * \\nHalloween finally came. \\nThe quartet walked together to the Great Hall, joking about their costumes. Doug had finally been talked out of going to the banquet as Tarzan, and was instead dressed as a prince from some fairy tale (although Lily and Becky had told him he didn\\'t look like any handsome prince they\\'d ever seen). Soup had decided to make a joke with his name, and was going as a can of tomato soup. Becky, however, had planned for usefulness instead of jokes and looks. She was going as a large orange pumpkin that she could stuff candy into for late night snacks later. Lily, surprisingly, was going as a pirate, not as a spider as many people had suspected. She had even drawn a beard and mustache on her face. Brownie and a few of the other spiders had helped to tie her hair under the pirate\\'s hat using their non-sticky webbing. She had borrowed an old pair of Neville\\'s boots, a pair of Doug\\'s black pants, and one of Ron\\'s red shirts, which she had to tuck in or else they hung at her knees like her pajamas. \\nThe Great Hall had definitely been decorated. On the far side, Nearly Headless Nick was standing in a doorway- or at least the wall next to the doorway, stuck half in and half out- jubilantly greeting all the students going to through the haunted house. Countless bats were flying around, though, surprisingly, none of them hit the ceiling once. \\nLily had to reintroduce herself often that night. Doug was busy going through the haunted house. Lily lost count around the twelfth time she saw him go through. Becky was busy talking with a friend of hers in Hufflepuff. The other girl and Becky were both busy stuffing Becky\\'s pumpkin shell with candy. Lily could already see that Becky\\'s costume was already bulging. Soup was eating as much of the food at the table as he could. \\n\"Have you tasted this stuff?\" he asked Lily in between a large gulp and three more swallows. \"It\\'s delicious!\" Lily looked around and realized that many other people were also stuffing their faces with the food. It must been good. No one had eaten like this even at the Start of Term Banquet. \\nLily went over to the table. She understood that Soup liked the food here. She did too. They had both been raised eating muggle foods and the food at Hogwarts was much better. She tasted a cupcake. \\n\"I don\\'t see what\\'s so different.\" \\nSoup shrugged and stuffed the rest of her cupcake in his mouth whole. Lily groaned and walked away. \\nShe found Brownie in a crack in a nearby wall. \\nWhat\\'s up? she whispered. \\nBrownie answered crankily, The bats are up, girl. Are you blind? They eat spiders. The only place we\\'re safe is in the walls and in the Gryffindor common room. \\nAnything interesting in Harry\\'s office? \\nBrownie gave a surprisingly human yawn. Boring. Now, then. If you\\'ll excuse me, I can\\'t stay and be your company all night. I have to go meet someone. \\nLily raised her eyebrows. \\nDon\\'t look like that, girl. He\\'s nice. A bit dumb, I\\'ll grant you that, but he\\'s nice. \\nGood luck, Lily said. \\nBrownie turned and walked away. \\nLily wandered off. Eventually, she caught up with Doug as he was coming out of the exit of the haunted house. \\n\"Lily! Great! Come on,\" he urged her. And with that, he turned and dragged her off to the entrance. \\nLily smiled at Nearly Headless Nick, who was greeting the people going into the haunted house and sometimes giving them warnings to try and scare them, as she passed and shouted an apology as Doug dragged her off before she could have a decent conversation with him. \\nThe first room was completely dark. \"You\\'ll love this,\" Doug whispered to her. Suddenly, a bat squeaked and a ghost appeared beside Lily, touching her arm. She gave a slight shriek and jumped back. Doug and the ghost laughed. \\n\"Sorry about that, dearie,\" the ghost said. \"Now if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ve got to get ready for the next person.\" \\nLily nodded soundlessly as Doug pulled her along, not believing she had been that scared. The next room was well lit. When Doug saw how large her eyes were, he started laughing again. \"If you thought that was scary, just-\" \\nWhatever he had been going to tell her was interrupted by thousands of shrieks from above, drawing Lily\\'s eyes upwards. A black cloud of bats seemed to be falling straight for her. She held up her arms so as not to be hit by them. At the last instant, however, the bats veered off their course and flew upwards again. \\nDoug was laughing at her expense again as well. \"Bats don\\'t fly into things,\" he explained to her. \"They have sonar for that. They\\'re nearly blind, so they locate things by sound. They send out a thousand little squeaks that bounce off of things to tell them where they\\'re going.\" \\nLily nodded. She had known all of that, of course, but instinct had made her act like a little child. \\nAnd so it went on. They went from room to room, always to be surprised. Lily tried her best to control herself while Doug acted nonchalant about everything he saw. By the time they\\'d gotten to the last room, Lily found that she had come to admire Doug for his bravery. She was sure that even if she had been through the haunted house as many times as he had that she still would have at least jumped, but Doug didn\\'t even tense up. \\nThey entered the Great Hall again, laughing. \\nThey looked around in surprise. The Great Hall was nearly empty. The few people left were standing around in silent groups, conferring amongst themselves. No one was going near the food. The next thing they saw was Becky, who was emptying her pumpkin suit of the candy. They made their way towards her. \\n\"What happened?\" Doug asked. \\nBecky looked at them, and then looked away. \"It\\'s Soup,\" she said quietly. \"And a lot of other people. No one understands it. Everyone seemed to get sick at once. The teachers took them to the infirmary.\" \\n * * * \\nHermione stroked her chin with her wand. \"What could have made them do this, though?\" she asked. \\nRon and Harry looked at each other helplessly and then back to her. \"We don\\'t have any clue,\" Ron told her. \\nHarry interjected. \"Yes we do. Voldemort.\" \\nMadam Pomfrey\\'s mouth dropped open. She hurriedly left to see to the children on the other side of the infirmary while the trio behind her shook their heads pitifully. \\n\"He\\'s the only one who would do this,\" Harry continued. \"I\\'m just glad Lily and James didn\\'t-\" \\nNow Hermione interrupted. \"Harry, if you haven\\'t noticed, Lily and James weren\\'t in danger in any case.\" \\nRon and Harry looked to Hermione beseechingly. She sighed and put her hands on her hips, looking disappointed with them. \"Honestly, haven\\'t you noticed that all of these students are muggle-born?\" \\nRon and Harry looked around. \\n\"She\\'s right,\" Ron said at last. \\nHarry nodded. \"I told you it was Voldemort.\" \\nThey looked back to Soup, who was lying on the cot in front of them. The soup can had been removed and he was lying under a number of sheets, all of which were soaked through with sweat. The heavy blanket on top, also soaked in sweat, couldn\\'t stop Soup from shivering. \\n\"Poppy said that if they keep going at this rate, they\\'ll be dead by tomorrow morning,\" Hermione said quietly. \\n\"Cure?\" Ron asked. \\n\"Haven\\'t found one.\" \\nHarry cleared his throat. \"Right. We\\'ll have to do a freezing spell on them until we can find a cure, then. Hermione, you and Poppy start at that end. Ron, you go get some other teachers to help. I\\'ll start at this end.\" \\nBy dawn, although all the teachers were all tired, they had frozen everyone in the infirmary. Classes for the next day and Monday would be canceled in order for everyone to try and find a cure. \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer- most of the characters in the following story were created by J.K. Rowling. The rest were created by me. (Sorry.) Copyright 2000. \\n Chapter Thirteen Caught \\nOn Monday, there was less cheering than had been expected when the students were told that classes were canceled. Everyone was all too aware of the empty seats. People were advised to stay in their common rooms for the day and not wander on the grounds. All day, owls were flying to and fro, carrying messages to worrying parents. Doug\\'s letter to his mom was nearly three times longer than usual. Becky spent most of the day with her father and Hagrid. Doug went up to his room, leaving Lily alone and not telling her what he was doing. \\nLily, being left alone, didn\\'t know what to do with herself. She wasn\\'t allowed to wander on the grounds, yet she hated being stuck in the common room, where everything was silent and gloomy. \\nThe spiders were all in Harry\\'s office, trying to find out everything they could about the illness and how the cure was progressing. \\nSpeaking of Harry, Lily and the others had never been able to make it to the library to find out why no one had told her he was her father. There had been too much to do between schoolwork, Halloween, luncheons with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Hagrid to find the time to go. \\nLily silently got out of her chair. Everyone else had gone to their rooms, preferring the privacy to the common room. She slid out of the portrait hole and noticed that the Fat Lady was nowhere to be seen, probably off visiting other paintings and listening to the rumors about what was happening. \\nLily hoped the Lady would be back in time to let Lily in when she got back and set out for the library. The first thing she noticed was that all of the halls were empty. The paintings were full of landscapes but nothing else. The Tin Men were absent from their pedestals. Lily didn\\'t even see Mrs. Norris or Mr. Filch anywhere. \\nWhen she reached the library, she was surprised to see that it was empty and that not even the librarian, Madam Pince, was there. She wandered over to a set of bookshelves and stared at them, not knowing where to begin. Well, everyone had told her that Harry was one of the greatest wizards of all time. Why not start with The Greatest Wizards and Witches of All Time? Lily pulled the large volume off the shelf and blew off the thin sheet of dust on it. Finding a table, she sat down and flipped back to the index. \\n\"Potter, Harry,\" she muttered to herself. \"Page 382-456. That\\'s a lot of pages.\" Nevertheless, she flipped back to page 382 and started reading. She read about how Harry\\'s parents- her grandparents- had been killed when Harry was one by an evil wizard named Voldemort, also called He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who. Harry had defeated Voldemort and sapped the evil wizard of all his strength through the power of his mother\\'s love. After his parents were killed, Professor Dumbledore, the greatest wizard of the time, and Professor McGonagall, both teachers at Hogwarts, and a man named Rubeus Hagrid, the groundskeeper at Hogwarts, had all taken him to stay with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley. The Dursleys had treated him awfully until he went to Hogwarts. There, he defeated Voldemort again with the help of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, and found the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. The second year, he had defeated the basilisk, who was working for a shadow, or memory, of Voldemort. The third year, he had helped get his godfather, Sirius Black, to safety and had come a step closer to finding out the truth about his parents. And so the list went on. Lily read until page 454, where she and James entered the story for the first time. They had been sent to the Dursleys\\' so as not to be found by Voldemort until they could defend themselves. Now, however, they were back at Hogwarts and receiving their education. \\nLily checked the copryright date on the book. 1768. However, she had heard of books that changed themselves in order to keep up with the times. She figured that this must be one of them. \\nShe spent the rest of the afternoon reading through Hermione and Ron\\'s biographies. She didn\\'t snap out of her phase until the clock on the wall screamed that it was time for dinner. \\nLily put the book back on its shelf and raced to the Great Hall. She noticed that the teachers were all pale and had shadows under their eyes- all except for Malfoy, at least. If any of the teachers noticed the children, however, they gave no sign. They were all eating slowly and feebly. \\nLily squeezed into the seat next to Doug and Becky. \\n\"What\\'s going on?\" she asked them. \\n\"Bad news,\" Becky replied sourly. \\nDoug sighed and began to give more details. \"None of the teachers have no clue what\\'s causing it. They\\'ve had to put everyone in the infirmary under a freeze-spell, or else they\\'ll be dead before morning. The problem is, no one knows about a cure.\" \\nLily nodded, thinking of Soup, and silently ate her spaghetti. As she ate, she thought that she would rather have Soup back than know why no one had told her about Harry being her father. She knew that, though. To protect her from Voldemort. Still, there had to be something she could do for Soup. She hated just sitting here doing nothing while he stayed frozen in the infirmary. \\n\"I hate this,\" she finally said. The other two looked at her beseechingly. \"I hate sitting here and doing nothing,\" she explained. \"I mean, I know why no one told me Harry was my father. It was to protect me from Voldemort. So why can\\'t I find out what\\'s wrong with Soup?\" She stared at her dinner coldly. \\n\"Are you suggesting,\" Becky said as she bit into a roll, \"that we try and find a cure ourselves?\" \\n\"I know. We probably won\\'t be able to pull it off,\" Lily admitted. \\n\"No, no. I think it\\'s a great plan. We can find out everything we need to from the spiders, after all. I think we should at least try.\" \\n\"Really?\" \\nDoug nodded in agreement with Becky. \"I think we should at least look into it. I mean, Soup is our friend, and I feel kind of guilty sitting here and doing nothing.\" \\n\"So that settles it. Lily can be the brain power. I can pump Hagrid and my dad for information, and Doug can eat.\" \\n\"Hey!\" Doug shouted at her. \\n\"What?\" \\n * * * \\nKnowing that the adults would not approve and probably send them away, the trio didn\\'t tell anyone what they were planning. \\nThat night, they began their operations. \\nWhat else did they say? Lily asked Brownie again. \\nI\\'m telling you girl, that\\'s all. They had a huge meeting today. All the Tin Men and paintings were there, too. No one had any ideas. But when everyone left, Harry, Hermione, and Ron said that Voldemort was behind this. Except this time, he may have actually won. \\nLily repeated what Brownie had said to Doug and Becky. \\n\"That\\'s bad,\" Becky said. \"Very bad.\" \\nDoug didn\\'t say anything. \\nThanks, Lily told Brownie. \\nWithout a word, Brownie turned and walked back into the crack in the wall. \\n\"Well?\" Lily finally asked. \"Where do we go from here?\" \\nDoug shook his head and admitted, \"I have no clue. \\nBecky, however, stared hard at a pillow behind Lily. \"When there is no other place to start, always search the library,\" she said finally. \\nDoug groaned. \\n * * * \\nHowever, although they had the best intentions in the world, their schedule made no room for such things. Melissa McKenzie, seeing all the free time everyone had, was using it for extra Quidditch practice. Although they rarely let the snitch out of the box, Lily still had to go. Also, the job called for stealth and secrecy, so the trio would have to sneak to the library. \\nA few times, however, they did manage to get a few minutes to themselves. The bad thing was that as soon as they reached the library, they never had time to do anything, and they couldn\\'t figure out where to look. \\nFinally, they came up with a plan to find out about illnesses first. Slowly, bit by bit through November and most of December, they worked their way through these, never finding anything to help Soup. Next, they checked up on curses and spells. Nothing. But they did find out one name that kept repeating itself everywhere they looked: Voldemort. \\n\"If only we could look at one of the books in the restricted section,\" Lily dreamily muttered one day. \"One time, I thought I saw something that looked like Voldemort\\'s autobiography, but the book ran away before I could get a good look.\" \\nDoug shook his head. \"Hate it when books decide to play tricks on you like that. One time, one of my mom\\'s books crawled into my bed and bit me. Thought it was great fun, too.\" \\nLily and Becky stared at him and then glanced at each other. \\n\"Not even I\\'m allowed in there,\" Becky said. \"Those books are really important. Harry said that he opened one when he wasn\\'t supposed to, and it screamed its pages off- well, almost. It screamed really loudly, at least.\" \\nLily sighed. \"So that\\'s that. We\\'re stuck.\" \\nThe others nodded grimly in agreement. \\nThey didn\\'t get a good break until Christmas. \\n * * * \\nBefore they knew it, Lily was playing in her first Quidditch game against none other than Slytherin. \\nBecky and Doug, who were sitting in the stands next to Hagrid, Neville, Hermione, and Ron, watched as Harry climbed over to them. He looked grim. \\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" Hermione asked. \\n\"Malfoy. He waited until this morning to tell me that James is now a Beater for the Slytherin team.\" \\n\"Isn\\'t that cheating?\" Doug asked. \"I mean, shouldn\\'t there be a twenty-four hour warning or something?\" \\nHarry looked at him thoughtfully. \"Yes. There should be a warning period. Then again, we should also have red cards in this game.\" \\n\"What\\'s a red card?\" Becky asked. \\nWhile the others were explaining the muggle world to Becky, Lily pulled her scarlet robe over her head. \\n\"Okay, people,\" Melissa said, swinging her broom over her shoulder. The rest of the team sat down expectantly. \"It\\'s a new year, a new trophy. We haven\\'t won for two or three years, but this time things are different.\" Everyone looked at each other and then to Lily, who blushed fiercely. \\n\"All I\\'m asking is that we go out there, and we win by a few hundred points,\" Melissa said slowly. \\nKevin\\'s jaw dropped. \"That\\'s all you\\'re asking?\" \\nChris shrugged. \"At least she didn\\'t ask for a kiss from me like last year. Now that would have been impossible.\" \\nMelissa glared at them. \"Enough of that. Come on. Let\\'s go out there and-\" \\n\"Kick some slithering Slytherin butt!\" shouted Peter Hamfrog, a boy who had grown up with muggle parents. \\nThe others laughed. \\n * * * \\nThe entire Gryffindor team recieved a surprise when they walked onto the field. Charlie Brunsley, the Slytherins\\' team captain, was beaming with pride as he waved to James, who was holding his broomstick and looking at them with an evil grin. \\n\"This is our new Beater,\" he told the Gryffindors. \"I believe you know him,\" he told Lily, sizing her up. Melissa and the twins moved slightly to stand in between Lily and Charlie. \\n\"Why didn\\'t you bring this up sooner?\" Melissa asked angrily. \\nCharlie shrugged. \"Didn\\'t have to.\" \\nProfessor Wood stepped in. \"All right, guys. Game time. Mount your brooms, and when I blow the whistle, go.\" \\nEveryone mounted his or her broom. James gave Lily a meaningful look as Wood blew the whistle. Lily went straight up into the air, looking for any sign of the Snitch. James went looking for the nearest Bludger. \\nFor a long time, not much happened. From listening to the commentator, Howard Smith (a Hufflepuff), Lily knew that the Gryffindors were ahead by nearly three hundred points. She had also noticed that the Slytherins were beginning to get a bit nasty. \\nThe first time James had hit a Bludger, he had sent it straight at Lily\\'s head. Just like the cherry bombs, she had dodged it easily and had even had time to say hello to Kevin, who had come speeding after it. The second time James hit a Bludger, she had said hello to Chris. Each time James hit a Bludger her way, she had a small conversation with one of the twins if they had time. Still, she was getting edgy. Neither she nor Andrew Flint, the Slytherin Seeker, had seen the Snitch the entire game. They passed each other in the air from time to time, and eventually Lily had managed to have the two of them on speaking terms, although they both made it perfectly clear that no matter what, they would each try to beat each other to the Snitch. \\nAfter an hour of flying around, chatting from time to time, and dodging Bludgers, Lily finally saw the Golden Snitch. She dived. \\nAlmost frantic, Andrew tried to see what she was looking at. He dived also, but she was on a Lightyear 5000, not a Lightning 500 like Andrew. To her understanding, that make had come out years ago. She was almost there 200 feet away and quickly closing the gap. She fell 100 feet. \\nIn a moment, the Snitch was flying away. Lily turned to chase after it and crashed into something. The wind knocked out of her, she started to slip off of her broom. Kevin and Chris finally floated over and helped her to climb back on. Blushing furiously, she thanked them and looked to see what she had crashed into. It was James, who was looking quite pleased with himself. \\nShe looked to Andrew, hoping he hadn\\'t reached the Snitch. He understood and grinned, showing her his hands. He pointed at James, shrugged, and flew away. She thanked the twins again, glared at James, and set off. \\nHoward Smith was having a field day with the commentary. \"An obvious attempt to apparently slaughter-\" Hermione glared at him. Immediately, he went on with the pure facts, although Lily heard him refer to the \"open attempt to murder the Gryffindor Seeker\" many more times throughout the game. She went back to floating above the stands and looking for a sign of the Snitch. \\nShe was only slightly comforted by Harry, Ron, Hagrid, Neville, and the others booing the Slytherins. She was surprised to find that even the Hufflepuffs and the Ravenclaws were doing the same. \\nFinally, she spotted it again. This time, she didn\\'t dive for it, as she had before. She slowly circled above it and floated downwards. The Snitch was floating right by Professor Wood, an inch or two away from his head. She swooped down when she was about two feet away and gracefully reached for it. She felt another hit from the side and lost her grip on her broom. Luckily, she was only about ten feet above the ground. She fell and slowed down before hitting the ground thanks to a spell some generous soul had worked. She looked up at James, who was glaring at her. Lily grinned and showed him and Professor Wood her hand, in which was the Golden Snitch. \\nBefore she knew it, someone had handed Lily her broom, and the entire Gryffindor team had landed and were cheering. Howard announced the score: Slytherin: 200, Gryffindor: 560. \\n\"Party in the Gryffindor Common Room!\" Melissa shouted. \\nLily turned away, grinning, and was faced with Harry. He hugged her, and she instantly remembered that this was the first hug she had ever gotten from her father that she could remember. \\n\"Good job,\" he said to her. \\n\"Are you coming to the party?\" she asked, slightly choked up. She turned away and coughed so he wouldn\\'t notice. \\nHe nodded. \"Sure. I\\'ve got a few of my own Quidditch stories to tell, you know. Did Becky tell you about the time I caught the Snitch by swallowing it?\" \\nLily shook her head. \\n\"Well, it was a match against Slytherin, much like this one, and...\" \\n * * * \\nHowever, the Gryffindors\\' triumph over Slytherin did not help the search for a cure. It was nearly Christmas, and Lily, Doug, and Becky had been through almost every book in the library. The only books left were the ones in the restricted section. \\n\"One of these days,\" Lily said, \"we\\'ll have to get in there.\" \\nBecky motioned to Madam Pince. \"You\\'re the brain. Figure out how to get rid of the teachers first, though. That\\'s probably the best way to do things.\" \\nLily\\'s eyes lit up. \\nBecky sat up quickly. \"Oh no.\" She hit Doug, who was looking at a Quidditch rule book, hard in the arm. \"She\\'s got that look.\" \\n\"What look?\" Doug asked, apparently seeing nothing in Lily\\'s eyes that made him think of whatever Becky was thinking. \\n\"The look that says she has a plan.\" \\nDoug thought and then looked at Lily. \"Next week is Christmas, though. Can\\'t it want until then?\" \\nLily pondered about this. \"Might as well,\" she said with a shrug. \"I\\'ve got the basic idea of what I want to do, but I have to figure out the first part.\" \\nBecky sighed in relief; Doug went back to reading his book. Lily started working on a paper for Charms. \\nNone of them noticed that James had come into the library, looking for a book to do the same Charms report that Lily was working on. So the Gryffindors wanted to get into the restricted section of the library. Professor Malfoy would be glad to hear that. \\n * * * \\nLily and the others had to wait until Christmas before any of them could do anything. A gift or two would make all the difference at Hogwarts... \\n\\n\\nYou know the drill. Most of the characters were created by J.K. Rowling. The rest are mine- Sorry if some of them are a bit off the rocker, round the bend, all that jazz. Anyway, Copyright 2000. Please read and review. \\n Chapter 14- Gifts and Questions Answered \\nOn Christmas morning, Lily took her time waking up. Two weeks ago, Hermione had passed out a paper to sign if anyone was staying at Hogwarts during the Christmas holidays. Lily, Becky, and Doug had signed up immediately- none of them were in a great hurry rush home. Becky\\'s reason was that she was already home, which Lily supposed went for her, too. She felt more at home at Hogwarts than she ever had at the Dursleys. Doug\\'s reason, probably, was because he didn\\'t seem to like his mom that much. \\nLily slowly opened her eyes and looked around, where newly fallen snow had layered itself on the windowsill in the girls\\' dormitory, and hers was the only bed occupied in the room. She sighed and sat up. Becky was with her father, and Doug was the only other Gryffindor in the Gryffindor house. She struggled out of bed, looking forward to the Christmas feast later that day. Becky and the others had raved about it to her for the past month. \\nAs she walked to get some clothes out of her trunk, she hit her shin against something. She jumped back and fell onto her bed, rubbing the sore spot. Cautiously, she looked at the culprit, and was to find that it was culprits- with an \"S.\" There was a pile of boxes at the foot of her bed on her trunk. There were more presents here for her than she had ever seen in her life! \\nShe picked up the first and looked at it. The tag read \"To: Lily From: Becky.\" It had been wrapped in The Daily Prophet newspaper, and she could see a bit of people and things moving in the pictures. She unwrapped it hurriedly, yet careful not to tear the paper. She realized with a start that she had become one of those people who cherished every memory. \\nShe looked at what fell out. A SpinMaster 05. She creased her brows and looked at it curiously. \\n\"MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" someone behind her shouted. Lily turned and saw Becky in the doorway, with a sleepy-looking Doug behind her, rubbing his eyes and dragging behind him his blanket and pillow. He shoved past Becky and stumbled over to Lily\\'s bed. \\n\"\\'Ry Christmas,\" he said as he started to go back to sleep on her bed. \\n\"Same to you, Bright Eyes,\" Lily retorted. \\nDoug sighed as he managed to sit up. He pointed at Becky, irritated. \"Her fault,\" he explained. \"She woke me up just so we could come in here and watch you open presents.\" \\n\"Well, gee,\" Becky said sarcastically. \"I\\'m sorry for being nice. Go on, Lily. What did you get?\" \\nLily held up Becky\\'s gift to her. \"What is this?\" she asked. \\nBecky took it from her, a childish delight shining in her eyes. \"It\\'s a SpinMaster- 05 version. See, watch this.\" She set it on the floor and pulled a string. They watched as the SpinMaster began to spin, gaining speed as it went. It started to float into the air before it slowed down and fell to the ground. Becky shrugged. \"I\\'ve never been much good with these things. Supposedly, if you do it right, it\\'ll float up into the air. You\\'re supposed to compete and see who can keep theirs in the air the longest. I\\'ve heard they can stay up in the air as long as an hour. So I\\'ve heard,\" she repeated, disgusted with how high and how long hers had stayed in the air. \\n\"What did you get?\" Lily asked. \\n\"Stop trying to change the subject and open the others,\" Becky ordered. \\nLily opened Doug\\'s next. \"It isn\\'t much,\" Doug said with a shrug. \"Just something from the muggle world. Lily ripped off the paper- yet still keeping it relatively in tact. In front of her was a copy of Sports Illustrated. \\nUntil then, Lily hadn\\'t realized how much she had missed the muggle world. But seeing the man on the cover playing football, she immediately changed her mind and thanked Doug until Becky rudely told her to stop and open the rest of the presents. It seemed that here, on Christmas morning, things were much as they were back with the Dursleys, except without Shelton and Pernella opening their gifts and tossing them away just as quickly. \\nHermione had given her an astrology kit. If the others set it up right, Lily might never have another astrology lesson ever again- if she could talk Professor Nadim into letting her off the hook. \\nRon had given her cherry bombs to throw at his nephews if Lily felt they needed it. \\nNeville had given her candy- Bernie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans, to be exact. They were pretty good until Doug found a mothball-flavored one. \\nHagrid had given her a book about dragons and a bunch of other magical creatures. \\n\"Open this one,\" Becky prodded her when Lily started to look at the pictures. \\nShe obeyed. \\nThis one was from Harry, and the second she undid the strings- which she thought was merely part of the wrapping, and not the wrapping itself- a puddle of water slid across her lap and lay on the floor. Lily, slightly confused, picked the \"puddle\" up. \\n\"It\\'s an Invisibility Cloak,\" Becky explained, both confused and excited. \"Hurry and put it on- it\\'s supposed to make you invisible. So I\\'ve heard, at least.\" \\nLily grinned and found the opening. She slipped it over her head. Becky gasped. Doug, who had fallen asleep again, mumbled again and opened his eyes a bit. He saw Lily and shouted before falling off the bed, waving his arms wildly. \\n\"DOUG! CALM DOWN!\" Becky shouted at him. \"It\\'s JUST an Invisibility Cloak!\" \\n\"It\\'s just her HEAD floating in midair!\" he retorted, trying unsuccessfully to calm down. \\nLily grinned and went over to the mirror, wondering if she was really invisible. She looked at her head, seemingly floating in midair- just as Doug had said- and gasped. She couldn\\'t see anything below her neck. She looked down at herself and turned from the mirror, possibly thinking that her reflection was tricking her. Just to prove its innocence, the reflection of Lily stuck its tongue out at her as soon as she had turned around. \\nLily looked down at the floor. Slowly, she reached to touch the floor with an invisible hand- only to hit something. She stood up slowly. She\\'d never seen magic like this, and she had never dreamed of becoming invisible. \\n\"Try the hood on,\" Becky urged. \\nLily obeyed and slipped the hood over her head as she turned. As she turned back to the mirror, her reflection immediately pulled its tongue back in and turned with her, slightly pouting. Lily finished pulling the hood over her head. Now she was completely invisible- she could see right past herself and see where Becky and Doug were goggling at the mirror. \\nGirl! Brownie\\'s voice called. Take that thing off this instant and come here. You\\'re acting like a robin, you know. Always trying to get what you can\\'t have! \\nLily sighed and took off the Cloak, explaining to Doug and Becky about Brownie as she folded it up. \\nThey nodded, completely understanding. \\nLily sat on her bed and placed her hand on her bedside table so Brownie could climb on. The spider did so quickly. \\nMerry Christmas, she said grumpily. \\n\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" Lily said in English so Becky and Doug could understand as well. She repeated it in Areanatu. \\nDon\\'t repeat yourself, girl, Brownie said grouchily. I can understand English just as well as you can. \\nAlthough Lily doubted that greatly, she kept it to herself. Instead she asked politely, \"How are you?\" \\nWhat? Brownie asked. \\nLily sighed and looked to Becky and Doug. They looked at each other and then left the room, apparently thinking the conversation was private. Lily hadn\\'t meant to chase them off, but they wouldn\\'t be able to understand the conversation anyway, so it was probably for the best. \\nHow are you? Lily repeated in Areanatu. \\nFine, thank you. \\nLily\\'s brow creased. Before she could help herself, she whispered, Manners? From you? \\nYes, girl, Brownie said as she waved her arms menacingly at Lily. What? Did you think that I was rude? Lily stuttered as she tried to find a suitable yet still honest answer. Brownie finally sighed. That woman Hermione has been talking about manners in Harry\\'s office. I knew I would pay for eavesdropping! Human manners seep in for me after being around you for so long! \\nWhat\\'s that supposed to mean? Lily asked. \\nBrownie sighed again. That\\'s what your Christmas gift is, actually. I told you about the Webs, correct? \\nLily nodded. \\nWell, a long time ago, a spell was recorded. You know how those grown humans you spend so much time with can turn into animals of choice? Well, with this spell, you will be able to turn into a spider. After all, you do speak Areanatu. \\nDo I have to pick a certain word? Lily asked. If she had to pick a certain word which she could only pick to turn into a spider, she didn\\'t know which one she would choose. It would have to be one she would only speak to turn into a spider, so it couldn\\'t be one which she would say often... \\nBrownie laughed. No. You turn into a spider merely by wanting to be a spider. You turn back into a human by wanting to be a human. \\nLily thanked Brownie emphatically. Imagine! She could actually turn into a spider just by simply wanting to! Then an embarrassing thought occurred to her, and she felt herself blush crimson. \\nWhen I change back, Lily asked,will I still have clothes? \\nBrownie laughed. A short distance away, Lily could hear spiders nearby also laughing. Why do you care? Brownie asked. I don\\'t know why humans even wear those things! \\nLily\\'s face drained of its color in the time it took for a street magician to flick his or her wrist. \\nBrownie stopped laughing and looked up at her. Yes, girl. You will have those useless webs wrapped around you when you turn into a human again. \\nLily thanked her again. You never told me what you wanted for Christmas, she pointed out. \\nBrownie turned around and marched off her hand, heading for the crack in the wall. Spiders have all they need, she said as she disappeared into depths of Hogwarts. \\nSomeone knocked on the door softly. \\n\"It\\'s all right,\" Lily said. \"Come in.\" \\nThe door opened and Becky stuck her head through. \"Time for food,\" she said with a grin. \"Interested?\" \\nLily nodded emphatically and raced after Becky and Doug as they ran for the Great Hall. \\nShe was surprised at how many people had stayed from other houses. Twelve were in Ravenclaw, six in Hufflepuff, and five in Slytherin, James being among them. All the teachers had stayed and were sitting in their usual seats at their table, but these weren\\'t the teachers Lily usually saw in all her classes or on the grounds. They were all... happy. Jovial, even. Lily watched as Hagrid pulled a bottle of eggnog out of his pocket and took a deep sip. Hermione saw him and tried to snatch it away, laughing. \\nThe other kids at other tables were eating like machines, stuffing as much as they could into their mouths. Lily saw the food appear on their plates and wasn\\'t in the least surprised. It looked delicious. She grabbed a piece of roasted turkey and dug into it. Halfway through, she slowed down. The food did taste good, but it didn\\'t taste good enough to make her or Becky and Doug eat the way the others were. Soup had eaten like that, and now he was in the infirmary- \\nIt finally dawned on Lily. She got up and ran to the teachers\\' table. \\nHermione and Hagrid stopped fighting over the eggnog and looked up at her. \\n\"What is it, Lily?\" Hermione asked. \\n\"It\\'s the Twick, Hermione,\" Lily said breathlessly. \\n\"The Twick?\" the older woman repeated. \\nLily took a hurried frustrated sigh and explained how everyone called it the Twick because Soup had always gone around saying, \"Twick or Tweat\"- and the mysterious illness most certainly hadn\\'t been a treat. Then she explained how everyone was eating just like they had on Halloween. \\nBy the time she was through, all the teachers were listening. \\nImmediately, Harry started giving orders. Lily, however, was forced to miss the action when Harry told her to go with Becky and Doug back to the Gryffindor House. Lily gave another frustrated sigh and spun on her heels, slightly angry that she wouldn\\'t be able to do more. She risked a look at the Slytherin table and saw James sipping sparkling white grape juice, unconcerned with everything going on around him. \\nLily pursed her lips together and went to the Gryffindor common room with Becky and Doug. \\n * * * \\n\"Hermione,\" Harry instructed, \"you get some other teachers and round up all the kids who are eating like that. Hagrid, Neville, you two search the grounds- see if anyone\\'s about. Malfoy, you go tell Madam Pomfrey. Ron and I and some other teachers will start the freezing spells in the infirmary. We\\'ll have to get the spells first, but we\\'ll meet you there.\" \\n\"Harry,\" Hermione interrupted softly. \\n\"Yes?\" \\n\"These are all half-bloods.\" \\n\"So?\" \\n\"We\\'ll have nearly less than a third of the school left. Especially if this happens again while the rest of the school is here. We need to find a cure.\" \\n\"We\\'ll work on it, Hermione. But right now, these kids need to get to the infirmary.\" \\nRon cleared his throat as he rubbed his wand. \"I don\\'t know about you guys, but I think maybe it might be dangerous to let the kids come back after Christmas holidays.\" \\nHarry didn\\'t say anything. He simply led the teachers to his office for the spell. \\n * * * \\nLily threw off her sweater in the common room. \\n\"There goes another group of kids to the infirmary,\" Doug said slowly. \\n\"We need to do something!\" Lily shouted, nearly in hysterics. \\n\"We need a plan,\" Becky reminded her. \\n\"I\\'m working on it,\" Lily said. \"I know how to get to the library without being noticed, but it would take forever. Even longer to find the right book.\" She explained about Brownie\\'s gift. \\nWhen she was done, Becky laughed. The laugh hinted that she had already lost hope about finding a cure. \"If you got another gift like that one,\" Becky told her, \"we\\'d be in business.\" \\n\"That\\'s it!\" Lily shouted joyfully. \\nBecky and Doug looked at her. \\n\"Don\\'t you see? I wasn\\'t done opening the presents!\" \\n\"How many presents did you get?\" Doug asked as Lily raced up the stairs. \\nLily\\'s laugh floated back down to them. \"A lot.\" \\nBefore Becky and Doug could climb the stairs, Lily came back down, waving a sheet of parchment. \"Look at this!\" she shouted at them. \\n\"What is it?\" Becky asked as Lily smoothed the parchment on the table. \\n\"It\\'s a map. And watch this.\" She took out her wand and gave the map a quick tap, thinking of the spiders. Immediately, the map was zoomed into by the trio, who could suddenly see all the pipes and cracks a spider might use to get around Hogwarts. \\nLily traced a path with her wand. It went from the Gryffindor House to the library. \\n\"The teachers are all busy now,\" she said slowly. \"The ghosts probably are, too. Which means that no one will hear the books scream- if we\\'re lucky.\" \\n\"You\\'re forgetting something,\" Doug pointed out. \\n\"What?\" \\n\"We can\\'t turn into spiders.\" \\nBecky nodded in agreement. \\nLily looked up at them. Then we can\\'t do this, can we? I mean, they\\'ll see us unless we\\'re really small. Not all the ghosts are in the infirmary, I\\'ll bet. Like I said, only if we\\'re lucky...\" \\n\"So? Go on without us,\" Becky urged. \"We don\\'t mind. After all, the cure is more important.\" \\n\"Are you guys sure?\" Lily asked slowly. She didn\\'t want to leave them behind, but they did have a point. She studied their faces as they nodded. They seemed to really think that she should go alone. She nodded to herself. \"I\\'ll wear my Invisibility Cloak. That way, when I\\'m human again, no one will be able to see me.\" \\nShe went and got the Cloak, pulled on the hood. She closed her eyes and thought about spiders. \\nSuddenly, her eyes were wide open. She was looking up at Becky and Doug from the floor. She marveled at how much they looked like giants from down here. They were larger than three Hagrids! And if she saw Hagrid from this height... Her head spun just thinking about it. \\nBecky got down on hands and knees and stuck her nose in Lily\\'s face. \"Oh, there you are,\" she said amiably. \\n\"That was cool,\" Doug said, looking at Lily in a small, slight state of shock. \\nLily, who had memorized the map, crawled under the floor boards and started her way to the library. \\nIt didn\\'t take her nearly as long as she had thought it would. Within no time at all, she was staring up at miles of books and tables all around her. Quickly, Lily looked for Madam Pince. Not seeing her, she used the spider\\'s sense of vibrations. No one was here. Juding from the faint vibrations, they were at least two floors away. She thought about being a human and suddenly found herself looking at the books in front of her from a normal height. \\nImmediately, Lily missed the feeling of being a spider. The certainty, the movements of the legs, being able to see in all directions at once. \"Hearing\" vibrations. \\nLily sighed and walked to the Restricted Section, intent on looking back on being a spider later and getting the job done quickly. \\nShe looked at the rows of books and finally pulled out a faded red book with a rubbed-away gold \"V\" at one end. \\n\"Please don\\'t scream,\" she asked quietly. \\nShe pulled the book open, her eyes squeezed shut. Hearing nothing, she opened her eyes and looked at the book. Instantly, the book chuckled in the low voice from her dream- the voice that had killed her mother and tried to kill her father. She dropped the book and fell, scrabbling away from it as quickly as she could. Blocked against the wall, she stopped and stared at the book, which had closed itself. She breathed deeply. \\n\"You\\'ll never be able to help anybody if you don\\'t find out about the cause,\" she told herself crossly. \"Now stop sitting here like a coward and do something!\" \\nTaking another dep breath, she crept towards the book and quickly opened it, hastily crawling backwards as she did so. She didn\\'t hear any more laughing. Cautiously, she crawled back to the book and looked at the first page. She started to read. \\nA few hours later, Lily\\'s eyes came back into focus, and she closed the book, feeling- no, knowing- that she now had the information she needed. \\nShe put the book back in its place and walked out of the Restricted Section. She changed into a spider and went back to the Gryffindor Common room, briefly wondering if anyone would be angry that a Hogwarts first-year had found the cure for the Twick. \\n\\n\\nMost of these characters belong to J.K. Rowling. The rest are mine. Copyright 2000 \\nAuthor\\'s Note: Sorry for the mispelled (misspelled/ mycpeled) words in this story. I\\'m typing really fast so I can finish it! \\n Chapter Fifteen- Voldemort \\nLily didn\\'t waste time going to the Gryffindor House where Becky and Doug were waiting for her impatiently. She wanted Soup and the other kids back as soon as possible. She went straight to Harry\\'s office. \\n\"Mars Bars,\" she told the gargoyle. He nodded and let her past. To the staircase, Lily said, \"Make it fast, George. I think I know the cure,\" and then held on for dear life as George twisted wildly upwards. She stepped off onto the platform, dizzy. \\n\"I need to get in, Fred.\" \\nFred shook his head. \"Can\\'t let you in without permission, kid. Sorry, but that\\'s just the way things are.\" \\n\"Fred,\" Lily said firmly, only slightly imitating Hermione, \"I know the cure. Now let me pass.\" \\nFred shook his head. \"Permission,\" he repeated. \\nLily shook her head and then shouted \"HARRY!\" as loudly as she could. \\nHarry immediately opened the door and pushed his glasses onto his nose again. Seeing that it was Lily, he smoothed down his bangs. \"What is it, Lily?\" \\n\"May I come in?\" Lily asked, indicating Fred. \\n\"Yes, of course. Come in.\" \\n\"Permission granted,\" Fred said with an evil grin. He held the door open for Lily and closed it after she had gone in. \\n\"What is it, Lily?\" Harry repeated. \\n\"I think I found a cure for the Twick.\" \\nHarry nearly shoved a paperweight shaped like an eagle off his desk. The eagle shrieked its protest and hopped back onto the papers it had been sitting on. \\n\"A cure for the Twick?\" Harry stuttered. \\n\"Yes.\" \\n\"What is it?\" \\n\"Well, you know how in your second year here, the Chamber of Secrets was opened and the basilisk came out and froze people?\" Harry nodded. \"You used Mandrake plants.\" Harry nodded again. \"Well, Voldemort was obsessed with those plants- actually, a kind of plant that was a relative of theirs, the Quintessa. You know, it jumps a lot, likes to hide, looks like a perfectly ordinary plant but acts... like a... child...\" She slowed down as she saw Harry staring at her. She took off again at warp speed. \"In his biography in the library, it says that he found out how to use Mandrake to make people sick, too. He extended it to the Quintessa plants, because those are a lot harder to find and add flavor when you slip it into your victims\\' food. They eat so much of the plant that it becomes harmful. Anyway, all you need to do to heal them is mix the Quintessa plants with a Phoenix\\'s tears.\" Lily looked beseechingly to Fawkes, who squawked his will to volunteer to donate tears. He shoved a bowl in from Harry\\'s kitchen and immediately started pouring tears. \\nHarry watched Fawkes as he did all this. \"How do you know all this?\" he asked Lily. \\n\"A book in the library. Don\\'t tell, but it was in the Restricted Section.\" Lily briefly marveled at how she could tell Harry, the Headmaster, not to tell she had done something wrong. \"There\\'s another book in the library that says you\\'re my father. I mean, I already knew, but it says why you had to give us up.\" \\nHarry cringed involuntarily. \"I\\'m sorry about that. I had hoped you would be safe. Dudley would have kept you safe from Voldemort since Voldemort thinks I would never send my own children there. I had a tough time there, but I figured you would be okay. But my cousin, I hear, was worse than he was years ago...\" \\nHe looked at Lily, who was rubbing her wand. \\nShe swallowed. \"Right. I wanted to talk to you about that, too. Um. I was wondering... I mean, Voldemort has already found us, right? So it couldn\\'t possibly hurt if we stayed...\" \\nHarry thought and finally nodded. Lily released the gigantic breath she had been holding. Harry grinned at her. I\\'ll call Ron and Hermione and tell them everything- the cure and the plans for you and James staying here. If they protest, I\\'ll make Hermione ride a broom in front of the entire student body and make Ron clean the entire school without magic.\" \\nLily beamed at him. \\n\"You\\'d better go. Tell the kids in the school who are still here, and I\\'ll get everything ready with the teachers, all right?\" \\nLily nodded. \"Can I pack up my stuff, too? I don\\'t have much, it\\'s just that...\" \\n\"You want to move in,\" Harry finished for her. Lily nodded. \"Trust me, I know the feeling. I\\'ll drop by after I\\'m done here and help. I\\'ll tell Malfoy to tell James, too.\" \\n\"Thanks,\" Lily said. \\nHarry grinned at her. \"Hey, I\\'m not the one who figured out the cure.\" \\nLily blushed and set out. On the way down the hall, she saw Hermione and Ron nearly run into each other as they told the gargoyle the password and dashed up the stairs. \\nShe started telling the portraits as she went about the cure, but didn\\'t mention her moving in with her father. She was almost giddy with the thought. Finally! She wouldn\\'t have to stay with the Dursleys! She was free at last! No more doing all the chores and the schoolwork. No more trying to hide from Pernella while her huge monster of a cousin chased her with her group of friends! \\nLily heard a noise behind her which snapped her out of her trance. She looked around. She wasn\\'t close the Gryffindor House yet. She turned to see if there was anything behind her. Her brow creased. She didn\\'t see anyone. She looked at the stone statue of Wendelyn the Weird. From behind it, a shadow moved. \\nLily jumped back and snapped her wand out of her robes. \\nJames laughed. \"Easy, little sis.\" \\nLily relaxed a little and even lowered her wand a little- but just a little. \\n\"What are you doing here, James? We\\'re supposed to be in our common rooms.\" \\n\"One: Supposed to be. Two: You aren\\'t in your common room, either.\" \\nLily lowered her wand and stood straight again. \"I had to talk to Harry.\" \\n\"What about?\" \\n\"None of your business.\" Lily, however, remembered suddenly that she and James were going to move in with Harry. That was James\\'s business. \"Actually, I told him that we knew he was our father. We\\'re moving in with him.\" \\nJames laughed. \"I\\'m not moving in with him.\" \\nLily gaped at him. \\nJames sighed and looked at her as if she were a small muggle child who didn\\'t understand she couldn\\'t fly. \"Lily, Lily, Lily,\" he said pitifully. He put his arm around her back. \"There are still some things out there that you are too young for.\" \\n\"We\\'re the same age!\" Lily retorted. \\n\"Oh, no. You\\'re brother and yourself are the same age, but I am much, much older.\" \\nLily tried to draw away from James. What was her brother talking about? The arm tightened. After a few moments, Lily found that the arm wouldn\\'t let her reach for her wand, either. She stopped struggling and looked at James. She looked at him and studied his face, eyes, stance, everything. His eyes were harder, older. His face was whiter. His stance was stronger, more certain. This wasn\\'t her brother. \"Who are you?\" Lily asked slowly. \\nJames, or at least the person holding her, grinned widely. \"I,\" he said with a great air of dignity, \"am Voldemort.\" \\n\"Volde-\" Lily shouted in shock. \\nShe didn\\'t finish the name. \\nVoldemort took out James\\'s wand and said a word. \\nLily didn\\'t even know what had happened. The only thing she remembered later was that suddenly, all the lights went out. She was unconscious before she hit the floor. \\n \\n * * * \\n \\n\"Okay,\" Harry began as the teachers in his office stopped talking and waited expectantly. Hermione and Ron glanced from Fawkes, who was still crying into the bowl, to Harry, asking for an answer although they spoke no words. Harry responded with a look that told them to wait. \\n\"We have found an cure for the illness, which is also known for the cure.\" \\nThe teachers, including Ron and Hermione, looked at each other like idiots. A few gasped in joy and surprise. A split second later, however, questions erupted from every corner of the room. \"Woodrow,\" Harry said to Professor Nadim, \"please go with Professor Hepatica and get together some Quintessa plants. Get some other teachers to help you brew those together with Fawkes\\'s tears.\" Everyone looked again at Fawkes, who was now on his third bowl, still bawling nonstop. \"Well?\" Harry asked, looking at them as if they were idiots. \\nImmediately, everyone in the office made a rush for the stairs. \"Ron? Hermione? Malfoy? Could you three stay behind, please?\" \\nAs everyone else left, the three teachers stayed behind. Ron and Hermione sat down in plush seats comfortably, only with a slight glance at the last teacher in the room. Malfoy swayed unconsciously on his feet, snickering slightly, but unsure of why he had been told to stay behind. The last time Harry had told him to stay behind for a talk, Fawkes had attacked him.Ron had entered the Great Hall flapping his arms ever since until a year ago. \\nMalfoy and Harry didn\\'t have many private discussions. \\nHarry sat back down at his desk and looked at Malfoy in the eyes. \"James is moving in with me tonight.\" \\n\"What! Harry-\" Hermione started as she jumped out of her chair. \\nHarry held up his hand to stop her. He was grinning slightly even as he made the announcement. \"Lily is, too. She visited me today. She\\'s the one who told me what the cure was.\" \\n\"You believe a first year would possess that knowledge?\" Malfoy sneered. \\nHarry nodded calmly. \"You have to admit, Malfoy. Lily hasn\\'t made one mistake yet. She\\'s smart. She\\'s memorized those books- at least that\\'s what I\\'ve heard...\" He looked at Malfoy over the rim of his glasses, a move which never failed to tick Malfoy off. He seemed to be looking for confirmation. Malfoy nodded slightly, glaring at all of them. \\n\"Plus, she looked in his autobiography.\" \\n\"That\\'s against the rules!\" Malfoy cried out. \"That book is in the Restricted Section!\" \\n\"Yes, but I think we\\'ll have to be a bit lenient, seeing as how no one else thought to check the book.\" \\n\"And why should they?\" sneered Malfoy. \"That book doesn\\'t have any information we don\\'t know in it. I\\'ve looked through in. Some others have. There was nothing in the book to-\" \\nHermione\\'s brow was creased. She interrupted Malfoy. \"What did the book say?\" \\nMalfoy grinned and chuckled maliciously. \"It was a joke. It said, \\'Born on a day, killed many, but never died.\\' I flipped through every page, and each page said the same thing- except the last one.\" \\n\"What did that say?\" Hermione asked anxiously. Harry and Ron exchanged glances, knowing that Hermione must be onto something and not wanting to break her chain of thought. \\n\"It said, \\'Try and get me.\\'\" \\n\"Lily said-\" Harry stuttered, determined to say that Lily had been telling the truth. Malfoy must be lying! He must! \\nHermione glanced at him. \"You\\'re going to hate me for saying this, Harry, but I think Lily was tricked.\" \\n\"How so?\" \\n\"Voldemort probably possesses the book. He enchanted it, that\\'s for sure. I\\'ll bet he told Lily the right cure. That\\'s how he is when he wants something.\" \\n\"Wants something?\" Ron repeated. \\nHermione nodded. Malfoy\\'s eyes became jumpy and rested on Harry at brief intervals before springing around the office again as the realization dawned on them. \\n\"Harry,\" Hermione said softly, \"Voldemort\\'s trying to kill you. Again.\" \\nHarry settled back into his chair, grim. \"Hermione, Malfoy, get James here. He\\'ll probably try to take either James or Lily as bait as he did with Ginny. Ron and I will get Lily.\" \\nHermione for once managed to hide her disgust at having to work with Malfoy and nodded. Malfoy did the same. \\nRon glared at them. \"He already has James- Don\\'t you see?\" he asked them irately. \\n\"What?\" Harry asked. \\n\"James. His character changed, remember? When we met him, he was just like Lily. And then when we went shopping in Diagon Alley, he changed. He became vain, arrogant, cruel, plotting- Everything that Voldemort was.\" \\nThe others stared at him blankly, another, deeper, more awful realization growing in their eyes. \\n\"Don\\'t you see?\" Ron shouted at them. \"He\\'s been here the entire time. He\\'s IN JAMES!\" \\n\"Hermione,\" Harry rushed. \"Are you sure Voldemort gave Lily the right cure?\" \\nHermione nodded. \"He wants you right now. Once you\\'re out of the way, then he can start with the muggle-borns and half-bloods.\" \\nHarry nodded. \"Right. Hermione, Malfoy, go and get James. NOW!\" he shouted as them as they hesitated. They disappered from the office in a rush, screaming at George not to stop and make them fall or else Hermione would blow him to pieces. \\nHarry looked to Ron. \"We\\'ve go to get Lily,\" he said desperately. \\nRon nodded. \"We\\'re in trouble, Harry,\" he said matter-of-factly. \\n\"I know,\" Harry said as he started running. \\nBy the time they reached the Gryffindor House, their faces were red, and they were out of breath. \\nThe Fat Lady looked at them, shocked. \\n\"Please,\" Harry told her. \"Has Lily been in here?\" \\n\"Lily? No. She hasn\\'t come out, either, though. I think she\\'s still inside.\" The Fat Lady opened the door behind her and gestured for them to go in. \\nRon thanked her as Harry dashed through. \\nOnly Doug and Becky were in the room, bored and on the point of falling asleep. \\n\"Where\\'s Lily?\" Harry nearly screamed at them. They jumped. \\n\"Uh,\" Becky began. Her mind, however, had frozen. She had never seen Harry scream. Or shout. Or even yell unless he was cheering for the Quidditch teams. \\n\"Where is she?\" Ron asked, much more calmly than Harry. \\n\"She-\" Doug attempted, but he couldn\\'t find any lie to cover up for the fact Lily had gone to the Restricted Section of the library in the shape of a spider. \\n\"It\\'s important,\" Harry begged them. \\nRon explained about Voldemort. \\nWhen he was done, Becky swallowed. She explained about the Christmas gifts from Harry- the Invisibility Cloak (Ron had glared at Harry, surprised, and then had understood, or at least seemed to.). And then Becky explained about Lily\\'s plan and Becky\\'s gift that enabled her turn into a spider herself. Doug and Becky hadn\\'t seen her since the end of the Banquet. \\nHarry stood in the common room, in shock. James and Lily! How could he have let this happen to them? He should have seen! \\n\"There is one other thing,\" Doug said after a few moments. He seemed surprised to hera himself speak when everyone turned to look at him. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Those papers to my mum. They were to her and... someone else.\" \\nHe looked at Ron, Harry, and Becky. \\n\"Those letters were also to Voldemort.\" \\n\\n\\nDisclaimer: J.K.

I had to write down everything I had found out, what was going on. How everyone was reacting to certain things- like James and Lily.\" His eyes grew to three times their normal size. \"I didn\\'t mean to!\" he stuttered. \"I couldn\\'t help it! I\\'d never turn in Lily on purpose! I\\'d never want to! I mean, I didn\\'t want to! And I didn\\'t want that to happen to Soup, either!\" \\n\"How did you get in contact with Voldemort?\" Ron asked. Harry collapsed into a chair nearby, and Becky stayed where she was, still staring at Doug with the same blank expression. \\n\"My mum.\" \\n\"What?\" Harry asked. \\n\"What?\" Ron echoed. \\n\"Huh?\" Becky asked feebly. She face was pure white by now. \\n\"I don\\'t know how she got in contact with him, but I think she\\'s known about him for a long time.\" \\n\"No wonder,\" Ron muttered as he sank into a chair. \\n\"Excuse me?\" Harry asked, incredulous. \\n\"In Diagon Alley, I kept hearing her talk about Voldemort and other things involving the wizarding world. I thought that perhaps Neville had filled her in, but now that I think of it, he would have never mentioned Voldemort\\'s name.\" \\nThey sat in silence for a while in shock. Becky managed to squeak another \"Huh?\" towards the end. \\n\"So Voldemort was here the entire time,\" Harry spat. \\nRon nodded silently. Doug looked down at his feet. \\nSuddenly, the door opened, and Hermione and Malfoy rushed in. \"Harry!\" Hermione shouted. \"James is missing.\" \\n\"So is Lily. It was Voldemort, Hermione. He was here the entire time, and we never even knew.\" Harry went on to explain about the letters from Doug to his mum and Voldemort. \\n\"May I see the parchment and quills?\" Hermione inquired. \\nDoug nodded and ran to get some of the spares he had kept. Within a few seconds, he was back. He handed the objects to Hermione, who sat down with them and started muttering over them with her wand. \\nFinally, she looked up. \"He\\'s right. These things were spelled. He couldn\\'t resist writing, telling the truth, and he couldn\\'t tell anyone about it. I could find out more, but I\\'d need time and the laboratory.\" \\n\"Then how come he told us?\" Becky asked. \\nHermione smiled crookedly. \"I think Voldemort keeps making the same mistake. Love can do a lot.\" \\n\"I don\\'t love Lily!\" Doug nearly shouted quickly. \\nRon and Harry looked at each other, but they couldn\\'t resist small grins. \\n\"Of course you don\\'t, dear,\" Hermione said, imitating Madam Pomfrey. She grinned at Doug to show she was kidding. \"That isn\\'t the only kind of love, Doug.\" \\n\"And I can assure you,\" Harry spoke up, \"that even if you and Lily did love each other in \\'that way,\\' I\\'m not going to let her out of the house for centuries after this, and it\\'ll be longer until she starts dating.\" \\nMalfoy cleared his throat. \"I think the Wonder Team is making plans for a future that may or may not be there.\" \\nEveryone stared at him in disbelief, disbelief that not only they hadn\\'t been worrying about Lily, but that they had been making plans for her future while she was in Voldemort\\'s hands, and the fact that Malfoy had been the one to speak up about it. \\n\"What?\" Malfoy asked irately. \"It\\'s true. Don\\'t you think we should get those two away from Voldemort first?\" He cleared his throat loudly as he realized he had said \"we.\" \\n\"Are you saying that you want to help us?\" Harry asked slowly. \\nMalfoy wrung his hands around his wand. \"Not exactly- Well, maybe. I think so, but then again... I think...\" \\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at each other. They quickly looked away, not wanting Malfoy to see how shocked they were. It was common knowledge that Malfoy\\'s family had fought with Voldemort, but Malfoy seemed to be offering to fight against him. \\nBecky jumped up from where she was sitting. \"The spiders!\" she shouted. \\nEveryone looked to the wall she was pointing at. Spiders were indeed crawling through the cracks and covering everything. Ron and Malfoy moved back a few steps unconsciously. \\nBecky walked closer to the wall until she picked out Brownie. She tried to remember the Areanatu she had learned from Lily and Brownie. \\nHello, she said in halting Areanatu. \\nGirl, keep your day job, Brownie recommended. Becky, however, didn\\'t hear her. The girl\\'s ears weren\\'t sharp enough to catch it. \\n\"What is she saying?\" everyone behind her asked at once. \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Becky said irritably. \"I can\\'t hear her, anyway.\" \\nBrownie thought hard. She needed a way to speak to them, but they couldn\\'t hear her. The spiders knew where Lily and James were, but these humans were too deaf. Athena curse them! \\nSuddenly, though, Brownie had an idea. She called to the other spiders and watched, slightly pleased although it wasn\\'t the proper time for it, that Malfoy jumped onto the couch and tried to use Ron as a wall. Ron pulled him off the couch and jumped on himself. \\nBrownie gave instructions and directed as four rows of spiders, varying in color and size, formed a straight line. She slowly directed the ends of the line to curve together. \\n\"O?\" Harry asked. \\nBrownie shook her head and directed the ends of the lines to pull apart a little. \\n\"I think it\\'s a \\'C\\',\" Hermione said. The others nodded in agreement. \\nBrownie straightened out the \"C\" and brought in two more lines of spiders. \\n\"H,\" everyone present muttered. \\nBrownie kept directing other spiders to make letters. Soon, the humans had a chain of them. \\n\"A.\" \\n\"M.\" \\n\"B.\" \\n\"E.\" \\n\"R.\" \\n\"O.\" \\n\"F.\" \\n\"S.\" \\n\"E.\" \\n\"C.\" \\n\"R.\" \\n\"E.\" \\n\"Chamber of Secrets!\" Harry shouted as he jumped up. Brownie applauded with her two front legs and dispersed the spiders. The rest of her eight-legged friends spread out over the wall, waiting to watch and see what happened next. \\n\"We need a plan,\" Hermione muttered to herself. \\nRon was about to say that they didn\\'t, but he stopped himself in time and sat in silence, thinking deeply. \\nHarry gave up on thinking. \"Hermione, if it\\'s taking you this long to come up with a plan,\" he finally said after thirty seconds, \"then there probably isn\\'t one to come up with.\" \\nHermione bit her lip. \"There has to be something Voldemort forgot,\" she insisted. \\n\"Voldemort?\" Malfoy asked. \"You honestly think he would let something be forgotten when he has the chance to kill Harry? He\\'s probably taken care of everything- even if it\\'s so menial as to be a stray hair. Trust me, I\\'d know. If I tried to kill Harry- not that I have,\" he noted with a small but unmistakably evil grin, \"but I\\'d make sure I got it right the third time.\" \\n\"So there\\'s nothing we can do...\" Hermione said more to herself than to them. \"Maybe we could wait him out?\" \\nShe looked up to the faces of everyone else in the room, all staring at her as if she were an idiot. \\n\"Or not. But there must be something!\" \\n\"How about this?\" Harry proposed. \"We go in there. We\\'re a group. We can take him on.\" \\n\"Well, we could at least get some more help then.\" \\n\"The teachers are all busy in the infirmary. The ghosts are helping them. The paintings can\\'t do anything.\" \\n\"Surely-\" \\n\"Hermione,\" Harry said forcefully. \\nHermione sighed. Her eyes suddenly lit up. \"Wait here!\" she shouted back to them as she dashed off. \\n\"But Lily and James!\" Harry shouted after her. When he got no response, he sank into a chair. He was perfectly willing to fight Voldemort, but he knew he was much better off fighting him with Ron and Hermione at his side. \\n * * * \\nLily eyes blinked open. Besides feeling a bit groggy, she felt perfectly fine. Not even a scratch on her. There was a pipe sticking into her back, but that was nothing major. She moved a bit and relaxed. She started as she saw James sitting next to her, his back against a wall. \\n\"Hey, Lily,\" he said softly. \\n\"James?\" she asked. \\nHe nodded. He looked to something slightly behind her, as if checking it. She didn\\'t have the nerve to see what he was looking at. \\n\"What happened?\" she asked. \\n\"Voldemort happened,\" James said dryly. \"He got enough energy and power and all that from the two of us to become human again.\" Lily sat up and scooted onto the wall next to him, still not looking at what he had looked at seconds before. \"He\\'s using us as bait to get Harry here.\" \\n\"He isn\\'t-\" Lily flashed back to her dreams from when she had been younger. She gasped and covered her mouth with a hand. \"He wouldn\\'t-\" \\nJames looked at her evenly. The light was dim, but Lily could still see that his eyes were red a slightly puffy. Suddenly, he hugged her. She hugged back. So James was James again. Her brother was back. Too bad Voldemort would kill them all now. \\n\"We can\\'t let him do it, James. We can\\'t.\" \\n\"I know. But I can\\'t-\" James swallowed. \"I can\\'t go up against him again, Lily. You have no idea what he-\" He cut himself off and shivered. \"I couldn\\'t do a thing, Lily. I couldn\\'t do a thing.\" \\nShe hugged him. \"It\\'s all right now. But we have to try and get out of here. Tell Harry that Voldemort is in his own body again.\" \\nJames slowly nodded. \\n\"Do you know where we are?\" \\nJames nodded and sniffled a bit. He shivered again and then became calm again. \"We\\'re in the Chamber of Secrets.\" \\n\"Chamber of Secrets,\" Lily muttered to herself. She grinned a little as the life and vivaciousness sprang back into her eyes. \"James?\" she asked. \\n\"Hmm?\" \\n\"Can you still talk to snakes?\" \\nHe looked up at her. \"Parseltongue? Of course I can. But how? All the snakes left, remember?\" \\nLily nodded. \"But they\\'re in the Forbidden Forest, and Parseltongue carries, just like Areanatu. See that pipe?\" Lily indicated the pipe near her back. \"I think that pipe goes outside. If we\\'re lucky, it\\'ll still reach the Forest.\" \\n\"If.\" \\nLily nodded again and shrugged. \"But it\\'s the best bet we have.\" \\n\"How will it help us, though?\" \\n\"Because those creatures, along with spiders, outnumber any creatures in this place, And Voldemort can\\'t fight off all of them.\" \\n\"But surely some of them will-\" \\nLily nodded, understanding. \"Sure, but they want to get back at Voldemort. And they have a witch and wizard to help them.\" \\n * * * \\nHermione dashed back into the Gryffindor House\\'s common room. Her smile was erased from her face when she saw that the room looked nearly bare. Harry, Ron, Malfoy, and the kids were there, but for some reason, the room still looked incredibly empty. She realized what it was with a shock. \\n\"Where are the spiders?\" \\nBecky shrugged. She was playing chess with Doug, waiting until they could go into the Chamber. \"Don\\'t know. They left. I tried to find out why, but Brownie didn\\'t answer back.\" \\n\"If they understood what she was saying,\" Doug said. \"Becky shouted in English, so we know they heard. I think the Ravenclaws heard, and the Hufflepuffs, so the spiders definitely must have heard. They just either didn\\'t understand us or ignored us.\" He ordered one of his bishops to take one of Becky\\'s knights and watched, pleased, as the bishop lifted its staff and knocked the knight off its horse. Becky pouted indignantly and nearly put her king in check. \\nMalfoy looked up from the cookies he was eating in the kitchen. Hermione saw that he had drowned them in vanilla ice cream. \"I\\'m glad those blasted creatures left. I\\'ve finally gotten my appetite back.\" He stuck a spoonful of slop into his mouth and gave a happy sigh. \\n\"I never thought I would agree with Malfoy,\" Ron said regrettably, \"but I do.\" \\nHermione\\'s brow creased in disapproval. Harry had fallen asleep while waiting for her. She was glad he was finally getting sleep; he hadn\\'t had a perfect night\\'s sleep in years, but he could choose the absolute worst times to catch up on his beauty rest. She kicked the chair he was in and he snorted awake. Becky giggled, and one of her chessmen tried to cheat. He was beaten off by Doug\\'s queen. \\n\"Well, if you\\'re interested,\" Hermione said, \"I\\'ve brought help.\" \\nProfessor Nadim stepped through the portrait hole. Along with the Yellow Lady and Nearly Headless Nick. \\n\"Hope we can tag along,\" Nick said. \"Hermione figured we could do some good, since we can walk through walls and- well, of course you know all that.\" \\n\"They do, dear. They do,\" the Yellow Lady told him. \\n\"You know me, Lady,\" Nick said with a grin. \"Always trying to make sure everyone knows everything.\" \\nThe Lady covered her mouth daintily and giggled. \\nBecky and Doug looked at each other, along with everyone else in the room, both looking as if they wanted to throw up. \\nProfessor Nadim, behind them, stepped forward. \"The other teachers didn\\'t need me for anything. I thought I might help somewhere along the way.\" \\nHarry nodded gratefullly. \"Thanks, Woodrow. I appreciate it.\" \\n\"We appreciate it,\" Ron corrected. \\n\"We,\" Hermione agreed. \\n\"Yeah, Woodrow,\" Malfoy said with a sneer. \"Thanks for going along with us on our suicide mission. Want some cookies n\\' cream? Muggle food. Awful, but it falls into the tastes of people around here.\" \\nHermione covered her hand with her mouth and bit her finger, staring at the \"muggle food\" with a murderous look in her eyes. Harry and Ron smiled at each other uncertainly. \\nMalfoy grinned at her, and Hermione gave a small humph and made a book appear with her wand in the air. Holding her hands out, she let the book fall into her arms. \"These are some spells we\\'ll need to know. Mostly for protection. Becky, Doug, you two will be staying here.\" \\n\"But Hermione!\" Doug and Becky shouted. \\n\"Harry, don\\'t let her,\" Becky begged. \\n\"Yeah, Ron. You too! Don\\'t let her!\" Doug joined in. \\n\"No,\" Hermione said firmly. \"It\\'s too dangerous.\" \\n\"She\\'s right,\" Ron said slowly. \\nBecky and Doug\\'s mouths dropped. Becky stepped back and sniffled quickly. She took one last look at Hermione, who looked away, and dashed off to her bedroom. After giving Hermione a quick glare, which the woman pretended not to notice, Doug went after her. \\nHermione cleared her throat when they had gotten out of earshot. \"Now,\" she began. \\nIt seemed like forever, but they finally left. \\n\"Ready?\" Doug asked. \\n\"Aren\\'t I always?\" Becky retorted. \\n\"You know, I know you won\\'t like my saying this, but I don\\'t think a bunch of protection spells taken from our first year DADA (Defense Against the Dark Arts) books are going to help us much.\" \\n\"Shows what you know. Come on.\" Haughtily, Becky led the way downstairs. \\nDoug wrung his hands around his wand nervously. \"Becky, we don\\'t even know where the Chamber of Secrets is.\" \\n\"You don\\'t,\" she replied. \"They were going to destroy it. There were a whole bunch of plans for it and everything, but then Malfoy figured he wanted it for his Potions classes.\" Doug shivered at the thought of having Potions somewhere worse than the dungeons. \"Yeah,\" Becky said, seeing him try to cover up for it. \"He was trying to convince everyone to let him, but he brought everything to a standstill. That was two or three years ago. I doubt anyone knows about it now.\" \\n\"We still can\\'t defeat Voldemort,\" Doug pointed out. \\n\"We aren\\'t going to beat him, just help out Harry, Ron, and Hermione a bit. All right?\" \\nDoug mumbled something in response. \\nBecky quickened her pace. She wasn\\'t going to admit it to Doug, but she was following the two pearly and yellow-colored ghosts in front of them. If they didn\\'t go to the Chamber of Secrets and changed their minds or something, Becky and Doug were out of luck. \\n \\nBTW, PLZ RE-Veu (By the way, please review.) \\n\\n\\nHi guys! So this is (yet) another part of the story. I think you\\'ll like it. Anyway, you know which characters are J.K.Rowling\\'s, and you know which ones are from my messed up imagination. Copyright 2000. \\n_________________________________________________________________________________________ \\nChapter 17 ~ Secrets Revealed \\n\"Ew,\" Becky muttered. \"Ew. Ew. Ew. Ewewewewewewewewewew.\" \\n\"All right,\" Doug hissed at her. \"I get the point, okay? Yeah, this is really, really gross. Shut up about it.\" \\nThe two were standing in the girls\\' bathroom with Moaning Myrtle standing nearby, her eyes red, as was her nose, which sniffled from time to time, but she was still looking at them with a look of amusement. There was a large, black hole in front of them, and Doug and Becky could feel the cool air on their faces as they stood there. Becky looked again at the walls of slime and said another \"Ew,\" partially in spite of Doug. \\n\"Look,\" Doug said firmly. \"They went down there. We followed- I mean, came here for nothing if we don\\'t go.\" \\nBecky\\'s expression went from grossed out to indignation, then suddenly to acceptance. Well, she had followed the others here. Apparently she hadn\\'t hidden the fact from Doug as well as she had hoped. She took a deep breath and released it shakily. \\nNodding slightly, Doug grabbed her hand, \"1... 2... 3!\" \\nThey jumped. \\n * * * \\nJames sat against the wall and shrugged. He and Lily had been speaking through the pipe for the past hour, it seemed. It had probably been longer. Neither of them had a watch that was in tact- Lily\\'s had broken at some point since Voldemort had attacked her in the hallway. \\n\"So that\\'s it,\" Lily said sadly. \"My great plan wasn\\'t so great.\" \\nJames shrugged again. \"It was a good plan,\" he told her, trying in vain to comfort her. \"I never would have thought of it.\" \\n\"That\\'s because you\\'re an idiot.\" \\nJames stared at her, his jaw hanging from his face as if it weren\\'t even a part of him at all. Then it dawned on him that Lily had been joking- It was sibling rivalry. He grinned. \"At least I look good.\" \\nThe look Lily gave him- one clearly saying that he was crazy- made him grab without a hope for a better insult. \"At least I don\\'t have friends with eight legs.\" \\n\"At least my friends don\\'t crawl around on their stomachs!\" Lily retorted. \\n\"SHUT UP!\" a man yelled at them as he walked towards the two. Lily gasped. This was the first time she had actually seen Voldemort. He didn\\'t look nearly as bad as she had imagined. He was about sixteen years old, and he had neatly combed jet-black hair. As if reading her mind, Voldemort grinned and said, \"I wanted to look good for when I met your father again. I wanted to be someone he would recognize.\" \\nLily bit her lip, trying to think. \\nVoldemort laughed. A malicious laugh. \"I don\\'t think so, Little Lily. I don\\'t think any of you are going to get away from me this time. No, not this time,\" he said more to himself than to anyone else. \\n\"I beg to differ,\" came a calm voice from behind them. \\nLily turned around to look. \"Dad!\" she shouted, half in joy, half in fear. \\n\"Dad?\" James asked. \"Did I miss something?\" \\n * * * \\n\"Don\\'t you have some comment to make about hygiene or something?\" Malfoy had sneered as he picked his way around a pile of slime. \\nHermione had raised her head and looked down her nose at him. \"Why? You\\'re a wizard. Take care of your own health.\" \\n\"Ouch.\" \\nHarry and Ron looked at each other. Ron kissed the air and fluttered his eyelids. Harry nodded in agreement. \\n\"Just what are you two doing?\" Hermione nearly shouted, seeing Ron. Nick tried to shush her by putting his hand over her mouth and merely managed to almost send her into shock with his freezing cold hand. \\nOnce she had recovered, Ron said innocently, \"Oh, nothing. You know, it has no relation to what we\\'re doing, really.\" Harry chuckled. \\n\"What\\'s that supposed to mean?\" Hermione warned, rubbing her wand with an evil glint in her eye. \\n\"That isn\\'t nice, Hermione. We\\'re friends, remember? It would be really lovely if you didn\\'t make threats like that.\" \\n\"You want to see a threat?\" Hermione asked sweetly. \\nHarry tuned them out, listening for any sounds. The Yellow Lady and Nick had somehow fallen behind them, and Harry couldn\\'t help but hear the Lady giggle a bit now and then, and Nick\\'s low laugh. Finally, up ahead, he heard something, ever so faintly in the distance, \"I don\\'t think so, Little Lily. I don\\'t think any of you are going to get away from me this time. No, not this time.\" \\n\"I beg to differ,\" Harry said evenly, wary yet still trying to seem brave. \\n\"We\\'ll continue this later,\" Hermione snapped at Ron. \\n\"Did I miss something?\" James had just finished asking. \\nVoldemort turned around. \"Well, well, well. If it isn\\'t Robin Hood himself. I see you left your tights behind you.\" He pointed his wand at Harry, ready to fire with a curse. \\n\"Oh, gee. Lookit, mister! He\\'s shaking!\" said a new voice. Everyone looked behind the new arrivals. \"Oops,\" Becky said from the shadows. \"I guess I said that out loud, didn\\'t I?\" \\nDoug swallowed and nodded. \"Ladies first,\" he said, shoving her into view. \"She did it!\" he told the other adults- carefully not talking to or looking at Voldemort. \"You know me. I\\'m just a young impressionable kid, and she- OW!\" \\nBecky had hit him as hard as she could across the face with her wand. \"My fault? You\\'re the guy! You\\'re supposed to take charge!\" James nudged Lily. They started creeping along the wall towards the others. \"I mean, I\\'m just a little, young, scared girl, and you\\'re stronger than me!- Yeah, yeah, that\\'s it! You scared me into making you come!\" \\nThe Lady snorted and quickly covered her mouth. She started giggling again. \\nJames and Lily were fifteen feet away and gaining. \\n\"As much as I would like to view the little comedy of errors,\" Voldemort drawled tiredly, \"I\\'m afraid I have business to attend to.\" \\n\"Your business is walking away!\" shouted a new voice hysterically. Everyone once again turned to see who it was, except for Voldemort, who made James and Lily stop where they were by pointing his wand at them. \\nStanding by an ancient basilisk body, now slowly decaying, was Hannah, Doug\\'s mother. \\n\"What is this!\" Malfoy shouted. \"A party or something?\" \\n\"A party? And I wasn\\'t invited?\" There was a small wail and a sniffle. \"Well, I\\'m coming anyway. I\\'m up for a party- as long as no one makes fun of me.\" \\n\"Uh-oh,\" Ron said slowly. He looked to Harry and Hermione. All of them were shaking their heads. \\n\"Where\\'s the party?\" asked the ghost, now coming into sight. She wasn\\'t the prettiest girl, but nor was the ugliest. She looked perfectly normal, except for her slightly red nose and red and puffy eyes, magnified slightly by her glasses. Moaning Myrtle stopped dead (suddenly), when she saw Voldemort. \"YOU!\" she shouted. \\nVoldemort rolled his eyes. \\n\"You were mean to me!\" Myrtle shouted, bursting into renewed tears. \\n\"Oh, geez!\" Ron shouted frustrated. \\nThe Lady moved towards Myrtle and spoke to her. Myrtle nodded and slowly composed herself again. \\nHannah stepped towards Voldemort, carefully trying to keep from tripping in her skirt, dress shirt, and high heels. \"Think you could let me know with a bit more notice next time?\" she said grouchily. \"I was in the middle of a conference.\" \\n\"There won\\'t be a next time,\" Voldemort assured her. \\nHannah was careful not to say anything back. \\n\"Mom?\" Doug asked, his voice halfway caught in his throat. It came out as a quick squeak. \\n\"Oh, honey. Hey. I, uh, didn\\'t know you\\'d, uh, be here,\" Hannah said with a meaningful look at Voldemort. He shrugged. \"I hope you\\'re going to get older,\" Hannah told Voldemort softly, seeing his mere sixteen-year-old complexion and thinking of her own forty-something complexion. \\n\"I\\'ll make you younger,\" Voldemort promised. \\nHannah brightened considerably. \\nJames and Lily looked at each other, hopeless. Suddenly, they heard something. \\nHonestly, girl. I told you would get stuck in your own web one day. Lily\\'s eyes lit up and she mouthed the word \"Brownie\" to James. Her brother nodded and put a finger to his lips. \\nJamesss, Jamesss, Jamesss. You found the old hangout, we sssee. This was not, however, Poison\\'s voice. \\nHarry noticed that Voldemort was listening now also; he had heard the Parseltongue too. He signaled to Ron and Hermione, who were watching the two men and the boy curiously. \\nWhere\\'s Poison? James asked. \\nI\\'m here, Poison called. I had to go to the Forbidden Foressst and get help. Got all the sssnakesss I could find. Couldn\\'t have done it without Aragog\\'sss help. \\n\"Aragog?\" Voldemort muttered. \\nHarry covered his mouth in awe. The snakes were sided with the spiders? But that meant that all the spiders- No, the basilisk was dead. They weren\\'t afraid of this place anymore. That meant the spiders... \\n\"Goodness,\" Harry said. \\n\"The entire population from Hogwarts, surrounding towns, and the Forest,\" Lily mouthed to him. \\nHarry wiped a bit of sweat from his forehead and told the others who were with him. \\n\"Who\\'s Aragog?\" Voldemort mumbled to himself. \\n\"Aragog?\" Hannah repeated. \"Aragog. Aragog. Why do I know that name?\" \\n\"Because you\\'ve heard it before, perhaps?\" inquired a deep, wheezy voice. Out of the darkness behind Harry and his \"party\", a long, furred leg appeared. Seven more attached to a slightly grey body followed, not even having to stretch to stand above the adults\\' heads. \\nMalfoy cursed loudly, jumping up and down uncontrollably. It wasn\\'t until Myrtle started laughing at him that he even tried to control himself again. Ron, looking up and recognizing the spider, went a ghastly white shade and desperately tried to keep his knees from knocking. \\n\"You speak English?\" Voldemort asked, thinking deeply. \\n\"Yes. Hagrid taught me.\" \\nThe claw reached for Doug\\'s mother. Doug closed his eyes and held onto Becky while Hannah screamed loudly enough to wake the dead. \\n\"If that doesn\\'t wake my mother up,\" Nick said optimistically, \"I don\\'t know what will.\" \\n\"Would you like to work for me?\" Voldemort asked Aragog calmly. \\n\"How DARE you?!\" Lily shouted at him, aghast that someone would try to hire a spider. James holding her back was the only thing that kept her from charging. \\nVoldemort laughed. So did Aragog. \\n\"The human knows much more than you,\" the large spider said. Voldemort\\'s grin faded a little. \"Never try to control or even suggest it to a spider,\" Aragog informed the wizard. \"A thing like that could get you killed. NOW!\" he shouted. \\nNOW! James and Harry joined in. \\nImmediately, swarms and hordes of spiders and snakes flew into the great underground cavern like a sea. Harry started running to Voldemort, yelling at James and Lily to get away from there as fast as possible. Ron and Hermione, not to mention Malfoy, charged Voldemort. \\n\"And that\\'s for making my family lose over half their riches!\" Malfoy shouted as he gave Voldemort a neat punch. \\nHermione snapped at Malfoy and called him something that would have made the wizarding and muggle worlds both blush with shame. \"You take his wand away first, you idiot!\" With that, she grabbed Voldemort\\'s wand away while he was still shocked from the punch and snapped it in half. Ron got out James and Lily\\'s wands from Voldemort\\'s robes and deposited them in his own. \\nMalfoy got in a few more punches before Harry joined in with the worst curses he could think of- as did Ron and Hermione. \\nThe two ghosts, Nick and the Lady, and Woodrow Nadim, the astrology teacher, went after Hannah as she ran away blindly, screaming for fear of the snakes and spiders. Moaning Myrtle ran along side, \"Boo\"-ing the living woman at each step. Hannah tripped, crying. \\nProfessor Nadim fell on her and backed up as he held his wand at the ready, preparing to do a spell. \\n\"NO!\" Hannah cried out. \"Tom Marvolo Riddle!\" Instantly, there was a blinding white light that set many snakes into fits of cursing and a burst of smoke which did not help the reptiles. The spiders started laughing at their legless friends- neither the sudden change of light or the change in the air affected them that much. \\nAn owl appeared, flying from the could of smoke. It\\'s face was a milky-white disk, set with two dark, wise yet fearful eyes. \\n\"Hannah!\" Voldemort cried weakly. \"Come back!\" \\nThe owl shrieked and flew back down a hallway. \\n\"Mom!\" Doug shouted after it. The owl didn\\'t even screech. \\n\"Doug! Becky!\" Lily shouted joyfully as she hugged them. \"You made it! Voldemort\\'s gone! And we found a cure! And James is back to normal! And everything\\'s just great!\" She paused and saw the look on Doug\\'s face, realizing what she had said. She hugged him tighter. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she said. \\n\"Don\\'t be,\" said a voice from behind them. They turned to see Professor Nadim. \\nDoug didn\\'t say anything. \\nProfessor Nadim sat down next to him on the ground. \"I must admit, you are quite a stupid wizard.\" \\n\"Stupid?\" Doug asked in shock. He\\'d never been called stupid by a teacher before. \\nNadim nodded. \"Your mother was not born a witch,\" he said slowly. \"I think Voldemort gave her whatever powers she had to serve him.\" \\n\"What do you know about my mother?\" Doug asked testily. \\n\"You said Voldemort\\'s name,\" Becky said in shock. What was wrong with people around here? They all said You-Know-Who\\'s name as if it were like any other! \\nNadim nodded. \"Your mother had to learn it from somewhere.\" \\nThe children looked at one another, confused. \\nNadim sighed. \"I introduced her to the wizarding world years ago- many years before any of you were born. She didn\\'t seem too disturbed by it. Indeed, she seemed to like having a wizard as a husband. I never dreamed she would meet Voldemort and-\" he swallowed- \"work with him.\" \\nDoug\\'s jaw dropped after a few silent minutes. \"Are you saying you\\'re my father?\" \\n\"Oops. I guess I should have said that straight out.\" \\nThe other adults had joined them by now, dragging an unconscious Voldemort between them. Hermione had apparently bewitched him somehow. \\n\"That means, Doug,\" Harry said calmly, \"that unless you want to go live with someone else, you can live with your father at Hogwarts.\" \\n\"Are you serious?\" Doug asked. \\nThe adults, all except for Voldemort, nodded. \\n\"All right!\" Doug shouted, jumping up. \\n\"And James,\" Hermione said, \"I don\\'t think you heard the news, but you and Lily are moving in with Harry tonight. Or this morning. I tend to lose track of time down here.\" \\n\"I\\'m here too!\" Becky shouted in delight. \"I\\'ll have kids my own age to play- I mean, talk- with! And better yet, you guys!\" She grinned and grabbed Doug\\'s hands. They spun around in circles, laughing, while Lily and James simply stood there, watching them and smiling slightly. \\n\"Too many kids,\" Malfoy muttered. \\n\"You behave,\" Hermione ordered sharply. \\n\"Yeah, Malfoy. Hermione would, uh, love- I mean, hate\"- he fluttered his eyelashes at this point- \"for you to be bad.\" \\nHarry burst out laughing. \\n\"YOU!\" Hermione shouted. She took out her wand. \\nRon, his face red from laughing, stopped laughing when he saw her wand pointed at him. \"Uh-oh.\" \\n\"Better run, Ron,\" Harry warned. \\n\"I\\'ll say,\" Malfoy agreed, taking out his own wand and smiling with evil glee. \\nRon took the advice and sprinted out of sight. \\n\"Lily,\" Hermione said solemnly. \\n\"Yes, Hermione?\" \\n\"I\\'m going to need to ask the spiders- a lot of spiders- to do me a few favors.\" \\nAfter a few minutes, Lily and James were finally alone with Harry as they walked slowly towards the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. James was still speechless. Apparently, he had been too troubled with Voldemort to even notice Harry that much. \\n\"One thing I want to ask you,\" Lily said. \\n\"What is it?\" \\n\"Who is our mother? I\\'ve done a lot of reading, but nothing ever mentions her.\" \\n\"Oh, that. Well, that\\'s because- Well, your mother is- OW!\" He rubbed a hand through his hair and groaned as it came away with slimy muck on it. He looked around to catch the culprit. \\n\"PARTY!\" Moaning Myrtle shouted happily as she chucked another ball at Malfoy. Seeing that it had hit him square in the face, Myrtle said happily, with her hands on her hips, \"And that\\'s for being so mean!\" \\n_______________________________________________________________________-- Please Re-veu. \\n\\n\\nHere it is: The very last part in the \"Harry Potter and the Twick\" series.

Copyright 2000! \\n________________________________________________________________________________ \\nChapter 18 ~ Another Problem \\nThe ghost stood there in his tropical shorts and Hawaiian shirt and sandals. He had tied back his long silver hair into a ponytail and wore his wizard\\'s hat lopsided on his head. He looked over his half-moon spectacles at Harry. \\n\"So Voldemort is over?\" he finally asked. \\nHarry nodded. \"He\\'s in Azkaban. I don\\'t think he\\'ll be coming back.\" \\n\"We told them to guard him 24-7,\" Hermione said. \"Not that we needed to, but I feel better telling them that.\" \\n\"24-7,\" the ghost, Professor Dumbledore, muttered to himself. \"I like that. 24-7\" \\nRon took a sip of his tea. \"We still haven\\'t found Hannah, though, but I don\\'t think she\\'s much of a threat.\" \\n\"Yes, I agree. She couldn\\'t even tell muggles about us unless she wanted them to think she was crazy.\" \\n\"Thank God for that,\" Harry said. \\nSomeone in the hallway laughed, and they heard Becky give a small shriek. \"GEORGE!\" Becky screamed. \"Don\\'t stop! GO!\" \\n\"Too many children,\" Malfoy muttered. Nadim saw Hermione looking at him and pointed to a heavy book on the bookshelf behind and above where Malfoy was standing, indicating how he wanted to pull it out and drop it on Malfoy\\'s head. Hermione rubbed her wand thoughtfully. \\nA few minutes later, Lily, James, Becky, Doug, and Soup crashed in through the door of Harry\\'s office, laughing. They stopped when they saw Professor Dumbledore. \\n\"Cowabunga,\" Dumbledore greeted them with a slight nod and a peace sign. \\n\"Cowabunga,\" the children slowly said. \\nAfter introductions were over, Lily went up to Harry. \"Hedwig just dropped this off.\" \\n\"Why didn\\'t she drop it off in the office?\" Harry asked, to himself more than to her. \\nLily shrugged. \"It looked like he was hungry. I think he had a mouse in his beak, but he was too far off to tell.\" \\nHarry nodded and read the letter. \\n\"Are you children ready for exams?\" Dumbledore asked. \\n\"More than ready,\" Becky answered. \"Except Soup. He gets exempt.\" \\nSoup grinned. \"Can\\'t say I weegwet it, eida.\" \\n\"James,\" Hermione said. \"One thing I meant to ask you. How did Voldemort possess you?\" \\nJames groaned and rubbed his stomach. \"I started feeling funny when you guys came to our hotel room. I thought it was the gummi bears. I probably shouldn\\'t have eaten them while they were mixed with butter.\" \\n\"I think that\\'s it,\" Hermione said. \"The butter must have had something in it. Voldemort would have affected the thing most likely to get to the most people. That way he\\'d be able to choose who he wanted to possess. Smart. Very smart.\" Dumbledore nodded in agreement. \\nHarry cleared his throat. \"I think we\\'ve got trouble.\" \\n\"What kind of trouble?\" Ron asked. \"Girl trouble? I might be able to help there.\" \\nHermione snorted and almost fell out of her chair laughing. \\n\"No. Worse.\" \\nHarry paused, not knowing how to tell them this. \\n\"OUT WITH IT!\" Malfoy finally shouted. \\nHarry sighed. \"All right, all right. Voldemort escaped from Azkaban.\" \\nSlowly, everyone looked at everyone else. \\nMoaning Myrtle, who had walked through the wall just in time to hear, wailed and ran off. Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at each other. Malfoy popped his fingers and punched the palms of his hands. Nadim bit his lip. Dumbledore \"Hmm\"-ed thoughtfully. Neville cried out and tried to hide under his too-small chair while Hagrid took a deep gulp of his brandy. The children looked at each other. \\n\"The library?\" Lily asked. \\nDoug groaned. \"The library. Maybe they have the Internet. I hate using books.\" \\n\"The libewy,\" Soup said. \\n\"Do I have to- OOP\" Lily grabbed Becky\\'s arm and started a mad dash for the library. \\nDoug, James, and Soup were the only ones left in the room besides the adults. \\n\"You have to admit,\" James said slowly. \"The wizarding world is never boring.\" \\n\"I hear that too much stress can be bad for you,\" Doug pointed out. \\n\"Shouldn\\'t we get to the libewy befo\\' the ladies?\" Soup asked. \\n\"The ladies?\" James echoed. He shook his head. Soup was trying his best to say words that didn\\'t contain R\\'s. \\n\"Let\\'s go research ourselves into suicide!\" Doug said happily as he sprinted past them and down the stairs. \\n\"Dad? We\\'re going-\" \\n\"Trust me, I think I know. Just get us involved when you get done with the research, okay?\" \\n\"You\\'d miss the fun?\" \\nHarry grinned. \"Trust me, we\\'re not missing any fun.\" \\nJames grinned and went off after Lily. Along the way, the Gryffindor team\\'s new Beater stopped in the kitchen. He wasn\\'t in any rush to get to the library. There, he met Doug. The two dug into the junk food- careful to avoid not only the healthy food and the butter as well. \\n\"Gotta hand it to the girls and Soup,\" Doug said as he stuffed another handful of potato chips into his mouth. \\n\"Hmm?\" James reached for some more of Bernie Bott\\'s Beans. \\n\"They don\\'t know when to quit.\" \\nJames nodded in agreement. \"Think this\\'ll happen next year, too?\" \\n\"Nah. Most likely Voldemort will try and kill us some time this summer. But look at it this way. At least we won\\'t have to come to school again next year.\" \\nThey laughed and kept eating. \\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Please Re-veu ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* \\nAuthor\\'s Note: I can\\'t say who the mother is just yet- trust me though- it\\'ll be good. I\\'m waiting until Ms. Rowling fills in some blanks. I meant for this story to be used from the release of the fourth book on. That\\'s why I\\'ve avoided a few things.

       "\"\\ufeffHARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE\\n\\nJ. K. Rowling\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ONE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.\\n\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\n\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\\n\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\\n\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\n\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.\\n\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\n\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\n\\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\n\\nHe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\n\\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”\\n\\n“— yes, their son, Harry —”\\n\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\\n\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . .\\n\\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\\n\\n“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”\\n\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\n\\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination.\\n\\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\\n\\n“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\\n\\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\\n\\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\\n\\n“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”\\n\\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”\\n\\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . .\\n\\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”\\n\\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\\n\\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”\\n\\n“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . .”\\n\\n“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.\\n\\n“Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do with . . . you know . . . her crowd.”\\n\\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”\\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n\\n“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”\\n\\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\\n\\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.\\n\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them. . . .\\n\\nHow very wrong he was.\\n\\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\n\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\n\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”\\n\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\\n\\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\\n\\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\n\\n“How did you know it was me?” she asked.\\n\\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\\n\\n“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\n\\n“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.”\\n\\n“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”\\n\\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”\\n\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?”\\n\\n“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”\\n\\n“A what?”\\n\\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”\\n\\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —”\\n\\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”\\n\\n“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”\\n\\n“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”\\n\\n“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”\\n\\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?”\\n\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n\\n“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”\\n\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n\\n“Lily and James . . . I can’t believe it . . . I didn’t want to believe it . . . Oh, Albus . . .”\\n\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know . . . I know . . .” he said heavily.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone.”\\n\\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\\n\\n“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . . all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”\\n\\n“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”\\n\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”\\n\\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”\\n\\n“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\n\\n“Hagrid’s bringing him.”\\n\\n“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”\\n\\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\\n\\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?”\\n\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\\n\\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”\\n\\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”\\n\\n“No problems, were there?”\\n\\n“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”\\n\\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\\n\\n“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”\\n\\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”\\n\\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”\\n\\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.\\n\\n“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\\n\\n“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!”\\n\\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\n\\n“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”\\n\\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\\n\\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\n\\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\\n\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\n\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\\n\\n“Up! Get up! Now!”\\n\\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n\\n“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.\\n\\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\\n\\n“Are you up yet?” she demanded.\\n\\n“Nearly,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”\\n\\nHarry groaned.\\n\\n“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.\\n\\n“Nothing, nothing . . .”\\n\\nDudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\n\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.\\n\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n\\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions.”\\n\\nDon’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\\n\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\\n\\n“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\n\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place.\\n\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\n\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\\n\\n“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”\\n\\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.”\\n\\n“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\n\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”\\n\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .”\\n\\n“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.\\n\\n“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right then.”\\n\\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\\n\\n“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.\\n\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n\\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.\\n\\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.\\n\\n“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n\\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n\\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”\\n\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.\\n\\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”\\n\\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.\\n\\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).\\n\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.\\n\\n“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.\\n\\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.\\n\\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “. . . and leave him in the car. . . .”\\n\\n“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone. . . .”\\n\\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\n\\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n\\n“I . . . don’t . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms.\\n\\nJust then, the doorbell rang —“Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”\\n\\n“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly . . .”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.\\n\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.\\n\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\n\\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.\\n\\nOn the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\\n\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.\\n\\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\\n\\n“. . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\\n\\n“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.”\\n\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”\\n\\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\\n\\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”\\n\\nBut he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\\n\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.\\n\\nHarry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\\n\\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\\n\\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\n\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\\n\\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.\\n\\n“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\n\\n“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\n\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\\n\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.\\n\\nIt winked.\\n\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\n\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\n\\n“I get that all the time.”\\n\\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”\\n\\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\\n\\n“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.\\n\\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\\n\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n\\n“Was it nice there?”\\n\\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”\\n\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”\\n\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\n\\n“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\\n\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\\n\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.”\\n\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n\\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”\\n\\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”\\n\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\\n\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\\n\\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\n\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\\n\\n“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”\\n\\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.\\n\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.\\n\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\\n\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\\n\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n\\n“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\\n\\n“Your new school uniform,” she said.\\n\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\\n\\n“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”\\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”\\n\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\\n\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\\n\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\\n\\n“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\n\\n“Make Harry get it.”\\n\\n“Get the mail, Harry.”\\n\\n“Make Dudley get it.”\\n\\n“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”\\n\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.\\n\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\n\\nMr. H. Potter\\n\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\\n\\n4 Privet Drive\\n\\nLittle Whinging\\n\\nSurrey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\\n\\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\\n\\n“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.\\n\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\\n\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\\n\\n“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk . . .”\\n\\n“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”\\n\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n\\n“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\\n\\n“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.\\n\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\\n\\n“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”\\n\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\n\\n“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\\n\\n“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”\\n\\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\\n\\nHarry didn’t move.\\n\\n“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.\\n\\n“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.\\n\\n“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\\n\\n“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house?”\\n\\n“Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\\n\\n“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want —”\\n\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\\n\\n“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer. . . . Yes, that’s best . . . we won’t do anything. . . .”\\n\\n“But —”\\n\\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”\\n\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\n\\n“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”\\n\\n“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”\\n\\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”\\n\\n“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\\n\\n“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.”\\n\\n“Why?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”\\n\\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.\\n\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, “I don’t want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .”\\n\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\\n\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\\n\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’”\\n\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.\\n\\n“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”\\n\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.\\n\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\n\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door —\\n\\n“AAAAARRRGH!”\\n\\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive!\\n\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\n\\n“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\\n\\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\\n\\n“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”\\n\\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”\\n\\n“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\n\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\\n\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\\n\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\\n\\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\\n\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\\n\\n“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”\\n\\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one —\\n\\n“Out! OUT!”\\n\\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n\\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!”\\n\\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\\n\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\\n\\n“Shake ’em off . . . shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.\\n\\nThey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\\n\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . .\\n\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\\n\\n“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”\\n\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\\n\\nMr. H. Potter\\n\\nRoom 17\\n\\nRailview Hotel\\n\\nCokeworth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\\n\\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\\n\\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\\n\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\\n\\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”\\n\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day.\\n\\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.\\n\\n“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”\\n\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\\n\\n“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”\\n\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\\n\\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”\\n\\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\\n\\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\\n\\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\\n\\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.\\n\\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.\\n\\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\\n\\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\\n\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.\\n\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\\n\\nOne minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . .\\n\\nBOOM.\\n\\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\\n\\n“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.\\n\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\\n\\n“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”\\n\\nThere was a pause. Then —\\n\\nSMASH!\\n\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\n\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\\n\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\\n\\n“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey. . . .”\\n\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\\n\\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.\\n\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.\\n\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\n\\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.”\\n\\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\n\\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!”\\n\\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\\n\\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\n\\n“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”\\n\\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\\n\\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”\\n\\nThe giant chuckled.\\n\\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”\\n\\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.\\n\\n“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”\\n\\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.\\n\\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”\\n\\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\\n\\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.”\\n\\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”\\n\\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\\n\\n“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”\\n\\n“Er — no,” said Harry.\\n\\nHagrid looked shocked.\\n\\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.\\n\\n“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”\\n\\n“All what?” asked Harry.\\n\\n“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”\\n\\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\\n\\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’— about ANYTHING?”\\n\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.\\n\\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”\\n\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”\\n\\n“What world?”\\n\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n\\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed.\\n\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n\\n“But yeh must know about yer mum and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”\\n\\n“What? My — my mum and dad weren’t famous, were they?”\\n\\n“Yeh don’ know . . . yeh don’ know . . .” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n\\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\\n\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n\\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!”\\n\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\\n\\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?”\\n\\n“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\\n\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a wizard.”\\n\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\\n\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”\\n\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\\n\\nof WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\n\\n\\nHeadmaster: Albus Dumbledore\\n\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\\n\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\nMinerva McGonagall,\\n\\nDeputy Headmistress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?”\\n\\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\n\\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\\n\\nGiven Harry his letter.\\n\\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\n\\nWeather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.\\n\\nHagrid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n\\n“He’s not going,” he said.\\n\\nHagrid grunted.\\n\\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\\n\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.\\n\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”\\n\\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”\\n\\n“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”\\n\\n“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!”\\n\\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\\n\\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!”\\n\\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”\\n\\n“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!”\\n\\n“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.\\n\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n\\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”\\n\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n\\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. . . .”\\n\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .”\\n\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.\\n\\n“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.\\n\\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.\\n\\n“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em . . . maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’— an’— ”\\n\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n\\n“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway . . .\\n\\n“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”\\n\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\\n\\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\\n\\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .”\\n\\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\\n\\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end —”\\n\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word . . .”\\n\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\\n\\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\n\\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\n\\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”\\n\\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see . . . he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?\\n\\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.\\n\\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”\\n\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\\n\\n“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”\\n\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?”\\n\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\n\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\\n\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled —”\\n\\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.\\n\\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!”\\n\\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\n\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\\n\\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\\n\\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”\\n\\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\\n\\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —”\\n\\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.\\n\\n“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”\\n\\n“Why were you expelled?”\\n\\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”\\n\\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n\\n“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDIAGON ALLEY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\\n\\n“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”\\n\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\n\\nAnd there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\n\\nTap. Tap. Tap.\\n\\n“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”\\n\\nHe sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\\n\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.\\n\\n“Don’t do that.”\\n\\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”\\n\\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”\\n\\nHagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n\\n“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n\\n“Knuts?”\\n\\n“The little bronze ones.”\\n\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\\n\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n\\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”\\n\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\\n\\n“Um — Hagrid?”\\n\\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n\\n“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”\\n\\n“But if their house was destroyed —”\\n\\n“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”\\n\\n“Wizards have banks?”\\n\\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”\\n\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n\\n“Goblins?”\\n\\n“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe —’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.\\n\\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”\\n\\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n\\n“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\\n\\n“Flew,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Flew?”\\n\\n“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.”\\n\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\\n\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\\n\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\n\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.\\n\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\\n\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\\n\\n“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.”\\n\\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\\n\\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”\\n\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\n\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”\\n\\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”\\n\\n“You’d like one?”\\n\\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”\\n\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n\\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.\\n\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n\\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”\\n\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read:\\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\\n\\nof WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\n\\n\\nUNIFORM\\n\\nFirst-year students will require:\\n\\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\\n\\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\\n\\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\\n\\n4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags\\n\\n\\n\\nCOURSE BOOKS\\n\\nAll students should have a copy of each of the following:\\n\\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\\n\\nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\\n\\nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\\n\\nA Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch\\n\\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\\n\\nMagical Draughts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger\\n\\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander\\n\\nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTHER EQUIPMENT\\n\\n1 wand\\n\\n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2)\\n\\n1 set glass or crystal phials\\n\\n1 telescope\\n\\n1 set brass scales\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.\\n\\n“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\n\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.\\n\\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”\\n\\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\n\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”\\n\\n“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\\n\\n“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be — ?”\\n\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n\\n“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . . what an honor.”\\n\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\\n\\n“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”\\n\\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\\n\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\\n“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\\n\\n“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\\n\\n“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\\n\\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.”\\n\\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\\n\\n“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!”\\n\\nHarry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\n\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\\n\\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”\\n\\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\\n\\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\\n\\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.\\n\\nBut the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\\n\\n“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\n\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\n\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\n\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n\\n“Is he always that nervous?”\\n\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some first-hand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\n\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n\\n“Three up . . . two across . . .” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”\\n\\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\n\\nThe brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n\\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\\n\\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\\n\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n\\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.”\\n\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad. . . .”\\n\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . .\\n\\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was —\\n\\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\\n\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\\n\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\\n\\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\\n\\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\\n\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\\n\\nA treasure that was never yours,\\n\\nThief, you have been warned, beware\\n\\nOf finding more than treasure there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\\n\\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”\\n\\n“You have his key, sir?”\\n\\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\\n\\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\n\\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\\n\\n“That seems to be in order.”\\n\\n“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”\\n\\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\\n\\n“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\\n\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\\n\\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\\n\\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\\n\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.\\n\\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\\n\\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\\n\\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\\n\\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\\n\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n\\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\\n\\nAll Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\n\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n\\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”\\n\\n“One speed only,” said Griphook.\\n\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\\n\\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n\\n“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\n\\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\\n\\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\n\\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\\n\\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.\\n\\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.\\n\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\\n\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n\\n“My father’s next door buying my books and Mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”\\n\\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Play Quidditch at all?”\\n\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n\\n“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\\n\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.”\\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”\\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”\\n\\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!”\\n\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n\\n“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in —”\\n\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”\\n\\n“So what is Quidditch?”\\n\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n\\n“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but —”\\n\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”\\n\\n“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”\\n\\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n\\n“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”\\n\\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.”\\n\\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\n\\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\\n\\n“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.”\\n\\nHarry felt himself go red.\\n\\n“You don’t have to —”\\n\\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\n\\nA magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\n\\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\\n\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\\n\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n\\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\\n“And that’s where . . .”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.\\n\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do. . . .”\\n\\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n\\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n\\n“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly.\\n\\n“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n\\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n\\n“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”\\n\\n“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”\\n\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n\\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.”\\n\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n\\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”\\n\\nHarry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n\\n“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”\\n\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\\n\\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”\\n\\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how curious . . . how very curious . . .”\\n\\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .”\\n\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\n\\nHarry swallowed.\\n\\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”\\n\\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\\n\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.\\n\\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\n\\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\\n\\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”\\n\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\\n\\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”\\n\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n\\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.”\\n\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\\n\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\\n\\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\\n\\n“Er — Uncle Vernon?”\\n\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n\\n“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.”\\n\\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\\n\\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”\\n\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\\n\\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?”\\n\\nHarry didn’t say anything.\\n\\n“Where is this school, anyway?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n\\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.\\n\\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\\n\\n“Platform what?”\\n\\n“Nine and three-quarters.”\\n\\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”\\n\\n“It’s on my ticket.”\\n\\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”\\n\\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\\n\\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”\\n\\nHarry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\\n\\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\\n\\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?”\\n\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\\n\\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.\\n\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\\n\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.\\n\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\n\\n“— packed with Muggles, of course —”\\n\\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.\\n\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\n\\n“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother.\\n\\n“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand. “Mum, can’t I go . . .”\\n\\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.”\\n\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\\n\\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.\\n\\n“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”\\n\\n“Sorry, George, dear.”\\n\\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it?\\n\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier — he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.\\n\\nThere was nothing else for it.\\n\\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.\\n\\n“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”\\n\\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to —”\\n\\n“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\\n\\n“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”\\n\\n“Er — okay,” said Harry.\\n\\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\\n\\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash —\\n\\nIt didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.\\n\\nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it.\\n\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\\n\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”\\n\\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\\n\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\\n\\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”\\n\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\n\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\\n\\n“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through the barrier.\\n\\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted.\\n\\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”\\n\\nWith the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\\n\\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\\n\\n“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.\\n\\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?”\\n\\n“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry.\\n\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Harry Potter,” chorused the twins.\\n\\n“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”\\n\\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.\\n\\n“Fred? George? Are you there?”\\n\\n“Coming, Mum.”\\n\\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\n\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n\\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”\\n\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\\n\\n“Mum — geroff.” He wriggled free.\\n\\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the twins.\\n\\n“Shut up,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.\\n\\n“He’s coming now.”\\n\\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red-and-gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\\n\\n“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves —”\\n\\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”\\n\\n“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once —”\\n\\n“Or twice —”\\n\\n“A minute —”\\n\\n“All summer —”\\n\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.\\n\\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins.\\n\\n“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”\\n\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\\n\\n“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —”\\n\\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”\\n\\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mum.”\\n\\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”\\n\\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\n\\n“Hey, Mum, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”\\n\\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.\\n\\n“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Harry Potter!”\\n\\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice.\\n\\n“Oh, Mum, can I go on the train and see him, Mum, oh please. . . .”\\n\\n“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”\\n\\n“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”\\n\\n“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”\\n\\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?”\\n\\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\\n\\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.”\\n\\n“All right, keep your hair on.”\\n\\nA whistle sounded.\\n\\n“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\\n\\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”\\n\\n“We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”\\n\\n“George!”\\n\\n“Only joking, Mum.”\\n\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\n\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\\n\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\\n\\n“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”\\n\\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\\n\\n“Hey, Ron.”\\n\\nThe twins were back.\\n\\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”\\n\\n“Right,” mumbled Ron.\\n\\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”\\n\\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\\n\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\\n\\nHarry nodded.\\n\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — you know . . .”\\n\\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.\\n\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\\n\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\\n\\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”\\n\\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\\n\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\\n\\n“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”\\n\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.”\\n\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”\\n\\n“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”\\n\\n“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.”\\n\\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\\n\\n“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.”\\n\\nRon’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\\n\\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\\n\\n“. . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —”\\n\\nRon gasped.\\n\\n“What?” said Harry.\\n\\n“You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —”\\n\\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn. . . . I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.”\\n\\n“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.”\\n\\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\n\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?”\\n\\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\\n\\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\n\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\\n\\n“Hungry, are you?”\\n\\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\\n\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.”\\n\\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on —”\\n\\n“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.”\\n\\n“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\\n\\n“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.\\n\\n“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”\\n\\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\n\\n\\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n\\n“He’s gone!”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.”\\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.”\\n\\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed. “Weird!”\\n\\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.\\n\\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”\\n\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\\n\\n“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”\\n\\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\\n\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\\n\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful.\\n\\n“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\\n\\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!”\\n\\n“He’ll turn up,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him . . .”\\n\\nHe left.\\n\\n“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.”\\n\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.\\n\\n“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look . . .”\\n\\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\\n\\n“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —”\\n\\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n\\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\\n\\n“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\n\\n“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”\\n\\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n\\n“Er — all right.”\\n\\nHe cleared his throat.\\n\\n“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\\n\\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.\\n\\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?”\\n\\nShe said all this very fast.\\n\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.\\n\\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”\\n\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\\n\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n\\n“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”\\n\\n“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”\\n\\n“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\n\\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?”\\n\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school.\\n\\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.”\\n\\nHarry stared.\\n\\n“Really? What happened to them?”\\n\\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”\\n\\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.\\n\\n“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\\n\\n“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.\\n\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\\n\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n\\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\\n\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\\n\\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.”\\n\\nHe turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”\\n\\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.\\n\\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly.\\n\\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\\n\\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”\\n\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\\n\\n“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.\\n\\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\\n\\n“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.”\\n\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\n\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\n\\n“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\\n\\n“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.”\\n\\nAnd so he had.\\n\\n“You’ve met Malfoy before?”\\n\\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\\n\\n“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with something?”\\n\\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!”\\n\\n“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we change?”\\n\\n“All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?”\\n\\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\\n\\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\\n\\nA voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.”\\n\\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\\n\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry?”\\n\\nHagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\\n\\n“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me!”\\n\\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\\n\\n“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”\\n\\nThere was a loud “Oooooh!”\\n\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\\n\\n“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.\\n\\n“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then — FORWARD!”\\n\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\\n\\n“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\\n\\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\\n\\n“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\n\\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.\\n\\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”\\n\\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SORTING HAT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\\n\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”\\n\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\\n\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\\n\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.\\n\\n“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.\\n\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.”\\n\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\\n\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”\\n\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n\\n“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.\\n\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.”\\n\\nHarry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\\n\\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed.\\n\\n“What the — ?”\\n\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”\\n\\n“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?”\\n\\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\\n\\nNobody answered.\\n\\n“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”\\n\\nA few people nodded mutely.\\n\\n“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House, you know.”\\n\\n“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\\n\\n“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.”\\n\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\\n\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.”\\n\\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.\\n\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.\\n\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:\\n\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,\\n\\nBut don’t judge on what you see,\\n\\nI’ll eat myself if you can find\\n\\nA smarter hat than me.\\n\\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\\n\\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\\n\\nFor I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\n\\nAnd I can cap them all.\\n\\nThere’s nothing hidden in your head\\n\\nThe Sorting Hat can’t see,\\n\\nSo try me on and I will tell you\\n\\nWhere you ought to be.\\n\\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\\n\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\\n\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\\n\\nSet Gryffindors apart;\\n\\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\\n\\nWhere they are just and loyal,\\n\\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\\n\\nAnd unafraid of toil;\\n\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\n\\nIf you’ve a ready mind,\\n\\nWhere those of wit and learning,\\n\\nWill always find their kind;\\n\\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\\n\\nYou’ll make your real friends,\\n\\nThose cunning folk use any means\\n\\nTo achieve their ends.\\n\\nSo put me on! Don’t be afraid!\\n\\nAnd don’t get in a flap!\\n\\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none)\\n\\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n\\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\\n\\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\\n\\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”\\n\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.\\n\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\\n\\n“Bones, Susan!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n\\n“Boot, Terry!”\\n\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\n\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.\\n\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\\n\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\\n“Granger, Hermione!”\\n\\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\\n\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\n\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?\\n\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”\\n\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\n\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\\n\\nThere weren’t many people left now.\\n\\n“Moon” . . . , “Nott” . . . , “Parkinson” . . . , then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil” . . . , then “Perks, Sally-Anne” . . . , and then, at last —\\n\\n“Potter, Harry!”\\n\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\\n\\n“Potter, did she say?”\\n\\n“The Harry Potter?”\\n\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?”\\n\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\\n\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\\n\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\\n\\nAnd now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\\n\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\n\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\\n\\n“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n\\n“Thank you!”\\n\\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.\\n\\n“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n\\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”\\n\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\n\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\n\\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.\\n\\n“Can’t you — ?”\\n\\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”\\n\\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”\\n\\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\n\\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”\\n\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.\\n\\n“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”\\n\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\\n\\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.\\n\\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\n\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . .\\n\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\n\\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mum didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”\\n\\nThe others laughed.\\n\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n\\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n\\n“N-nothing.”\\n\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.\\n\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”\\n\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.\\n\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\n\\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\\n\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n\\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”\\n\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n\\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.\\n\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”\\n\\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.\\n\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n\\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”\\n\\nAnd the school bellowed:\\n\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\n\\nTeach us something please,\\n\\nWhether we be old and bald\\n\\nOr young with scabby knees,\\n\\nOur heads could do with filling\\n\\nWith some interesting stuff,\\n\\nFor now they’re bare and full of air,\\n\\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\\n\\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\\n\\nBring back what we’ve forgot,\\n\\nJust do your best, we’ll do the rest,\\n\\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\\n\\n“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”\\n\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\n\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\\n\\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”\\n\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\n\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n\\n“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”\\n\\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.\\n\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”\\n\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n\\n“Password?” she said.\\n\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\\n\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\n\\n“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”\\n\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\\n\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\\n\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere, look.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”\\n\\n“Wearing the glasses?”\\n\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\n\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\\n\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\\n\\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\n\\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.\\n\\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\n\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\\n\\n“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”\\n\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\n\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\n\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\\n\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”\\n\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\\n\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\\n\\nHagrid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\\n\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\n\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n\\n“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”\\n\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n\\n“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”\\n\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.\\n\\n“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”\\n\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.\\n\\nSnape’s lips curled into a sneer.\\n\\n“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”\\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?”\\n\\nHarry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”\\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”\\n\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.”\\n\\nThings didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?”\\n\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n\\n“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n\\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”\\n\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\\n\\n“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”\\n\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much?\\n\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”\\n\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\\n\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.”\\n\\nHagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\\n\\n“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\\n\\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\\n\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n\\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\\n\\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\n\\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”\\n\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.\\n\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\n\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\\n\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.”\\n\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\\n\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n\\n“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.\\n\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!”\\n\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\\n\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”\\n\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”\\n\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\\n\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\\n\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\n\\nHarry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\\n\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n\\n“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh . . .” His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “. . . you’ve forgotten something . . .”\\n\\nNeville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\\n\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n\\n“What’s going on?”\\n\\n“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”\\n\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\n\\n“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\\n\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\n\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\n\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\\n\\n“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”\\n\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\\n\\n“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’”\\n\\n“UP!” everyone shouted.\\n\\nHarry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\n\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years.\\n\\n“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two —”\\n\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.\\n\\n“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and —\\n\\nWHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n\\n“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.”\\n\\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\\n\\n“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”\\n\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\n\\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n\\n“Did you see his face, the great lump?”\\n\\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\\n\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.\\n\\n“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”\\n\\n“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”\\n\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n\\n“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\\n\\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\\n\\n“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?”\\n\\n“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”\\n\\nHarry grabbed his broom.\\n\\n“No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”\\n\\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\\n\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\\n\\n“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”\\n\\n“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\n\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\n\\n“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.\\n\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n\\n“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\n\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\\n\\n“HARRY POTTER!”\\n\\nHis heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n\\n“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your neck —”\\n\\n“It wasn’t his fault, Professor —”\\n\\n“Be quiet, Miss Patil —”\\n\\n“But Malfoy —”\\n\\n“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”\\n\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\\n\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\\n\\n“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?”\\n\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\\n\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused.\\n\\n“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\n\\n“In here.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n\\n“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n\\n“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”\\n\\nWood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n\\n“Are you serious, Professor?”\\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?”\\n\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\\n\\n“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.”\\n\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\n\\n“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\\n\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall explained.\\n\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . .”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.”\\n\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”\\n\\n“You’re joking.”\\n\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.\\n\\n“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about —”\\n\\n“— a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”\\n\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”\\n\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?”\\n\\n“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\\n\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s yours?”\\n\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n\\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”\\n\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\\n\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re my second?”\\n\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.”\\n\\n“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\\n\\n“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.\\n\\n“Excuse me.”\\n\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\\n\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”\\n\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.”\\n\\n“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Good-bye,” said Ron.\\n\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.\\n\\n“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”\\n\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”\\n\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\\n\\n“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”\\n\\n“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n\\n“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\\n\\nHermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\n\\n“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.”\\n\\n“Go away.”\\n\\n“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”\\n\\nBut what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\n“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.\\n\\n“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be late.”\\n\\nThey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\\n\\n“I’m coming with you,” she said.\\n\\n“You are not.”\\n\\n“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.”\\n\\n“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.\\n\\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard something.”\\n\\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\\n\\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\n\\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n\\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”\\n\\n“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”\\n\\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.”\\n\\n“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later —”\\n\\n“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”\\n\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\\n\\n“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”\\n\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\\n\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\\n\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\\n\\n“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.\\n\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.\\n\\n“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”\\n\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\\n\\n“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.”\\n\\n“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\\n\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\n\\n“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\\n\\n“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\n\\n“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.”\\n\\n“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.”\\n\\n“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”\\n\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.\\n\\n“Let’s go.”\\n\\nIt wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\\n\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\n\\n“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”\\n\\nPeeves cackled.\\n\\n“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”\\n\\n“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”\\n\\n“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”\\n\\n“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake.\\n\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”\\n\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.\\n\\n“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!”\\n\\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves’s shouts.\\n\\n“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”\\n\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n\\n“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”\\n\\n“Say ‘please.’”\\n\\n“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”\\n\\n“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\\n\\n“All right — please.”\\n\\n“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\\n\\n“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What?”\\n\\nHarry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\\n\\nThey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\\n\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\n\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\n\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.\\n\\nThey fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\\n\\n“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\\n\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.\\n\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\n\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.\\n\\n“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”\\n\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.”\\n\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.”\\n\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\n\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”\\n\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\n\\n“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.\\n\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHALLOWEEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMalfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\n\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\n\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\n\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\n\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\\n\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even touched one.”\\n\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\\n\\n“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.”\\n\\nRon couldn’t resist it.\\n\\n“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.”\\n\\n“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.”\\n\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow.\\n\\n“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\\n\\n“Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?”\\n\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added.\\n\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.\\n\\n“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. . . .”\\n\\n“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.\\n\\n“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\\n\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\\n\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\n\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n\\n“Hey, Potter, come down!”\\n\\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\\n\\n“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\\n\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n\\n“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.”\\n\\n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\\n\\n“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”\\n\\n“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\\n\\n“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.”\\n\\n“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n\\n“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\\n\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n\\n“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are the Bludgers.”\\n\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\\n\\n“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\\n\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\\n\\n“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”\\n\\n“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off.\\n\\n“Very good,” said Wood.\\n\\n“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\\n\\n“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”\\n\\n“— unless they crack my head open.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”\\n\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\\n\\n“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\\n\\n“Well, that’s it — any questions?”\\n\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\\n\\n“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.”\\n\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\n\\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.\\n\\n“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”\\n\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.\\n\\nRon, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.\\n\\n“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\\n\\n“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”\\n\\n“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\\n\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”\\n\\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\\n\\n“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”\\n\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\\n\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears.\\n\\n“I think she heard you.”\\n\\n“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”\\n\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\\n\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”\\n\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\n\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.\\n\\n“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!”\\n\\nPercy was in his element.\\n\\n“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”\\n\\n“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n\\n“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”\\n\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.\\n\\n“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”\\n\\n“What about her?”\\n\\n“She doesn’t know about the troll.”\\n\\nRon bit his lip.\\n\\n“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”\\n\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\\n\\n“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\n\\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\\n\\n“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\\n\\n“Search me.”\\n\\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps.\\n\\n“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\\n\\n“Can you smell something?”\\n\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\n\\nAnd then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\n\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\n\\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\n\\n“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”\\n\\n“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\\n\\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\\n\\n“Yes!”\\n\\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up.\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n\\n“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\\n\\n“Hermione!” they said together.\\n\\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\n\\nHermione Granger w\\n\""
